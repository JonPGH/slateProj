0,3,Chase Burns,SP,Reds,Debuted,Hunter Greene / Dylan Cease mash up,"Insane fastball / slider combo that could be one of the best in baseball.  Burns just went on the IL with a flexor strain, but the Reds had already been talking about limiting the workload and it sounds like he avoided a serious injury and could be throwing again shortly, though word is he may not come back this season still as a precaution.  The fastball / slider combo is downright dirty for Burns, by major league Stuff+ he has the fifth best fastball in baseball, a top 10 sinker (he’s only thrown 4, all above 100 mph) and the fourth best slider in baseball.","Burns is putting up some ridiculous numbers through his debut and had a successful climb through the minors reminiscent of Paul Skenes.  Burns is slated as a top 10 dynasty starter for me and a top 15 re-draft starter.  While there are a number of pitching prospects I like, none have the elite stuff of Chase Burns.",5,45/50,40/40,50/55,70/70,,,,,,,,,,,70/80,,
1,8,Nolan McLean,SP,Mets,Debuted,Tanner Bibee / Luis Severino mash,"McLean is focusing on pitching for the first year of his minor league career and we are seeing an uptick in the effectiveness of his stuff.  His arsenal includes a mediocre mid 90s fastball (that tops out at 98), a potential elite late breaking vertical sweeper with a unique hard cut at the tail end of the pitch with a sinker that sits in the mid 90s and had a 75% GB% in AAA along with an 88-90 mph cutter with slider break, an 85-88 mph changeup and a low 80s big hooking curve that is his best swing and miss pitch.","McLean has improved as he has climbed the ranks with each outing even into the majors where he has gotten even better by using his expanded arsenal rather than one or two elite pitches to go from a thrower with interesting stuff to a high end pitcher with a phenomenal approach, but lacks the elite level pitches of Chase Burns.",41,50/55,65/70,55/60,55/65,,,,,,60/65,,,,60/65,,,50/55
2,15,Thomas White,SP,Marlins,Mid/Late 2026,Carlos Rodon Arsenal / Big Nick Lodolo Mechanics mash up,"White is a big 6’ 5” lefty who I saw live both in A ball last year and in the Spring Breakout game this spring with noticeable differences in his repertoire that has made his stuff very impressive, while he needs to work on harnessing the command.  He throws from an under ¾ arm-slot, though not quite side-arm and has some ridiculous stuff. Over the last season the fastball added about an inch of horizontal run to it while maintaining velocity.  He also added a sweeper to the arsenal against a vertical gyro slider, while his old slider was almost a slurve with a lot of loop at a slower 80 mph.  The new duel slider combo was not super effective in the limited 2025 data we have through only two AAA starts and it’s important to know when referencing the above data the slider will be skewed as its combining the 2024 slurve version of the pitch with the 2025 hard vertical gyro version of the pitch into one data set.  The sweeper is only a 2025 pitch with a great 2-plane movement profile and more velocity than the old slurve.","White is my top non-debuted starter at this point in time and it will be interesting to see how quickly the Marlins move him this year.  I would assume he spends the majority of the year at AAA and he possibly comes up around the trade deadline or in September, but if the Marlins wanted to push some chips in this year he and Snelling could both be up early in an attempt to actually win some ball games this year.  The command could lead to some bad games from White, but I think the stuff is so good the higher walk rate won’t overly affect him and we could ultimately get some Dylan Cease like outcomes from the left side.",17,55/60,,35/45,60/65,,,,,,,,,,,50/55,65/70,
3,18,Trey Yesavage,SP,Blue Jays,Debuted,Righty Clayton Kershaw light w/ a splitter,"Big righty with a super over-the-top trebuchet like delivery that throws a solid fastball, slider, cutter and changeup combo.  Yesavage has an above average 13.2 SwStr% on the fastball with a ridiculous 12.1” of vertical break (not including gravity), but his most impressive pitch is the slider (also sometimes labeled a cutter due to its tight break) which has a 29.2 SwStr% on the season in the minors and a 16.2 SwStr% in the majors.  The splitter had an insane 34.1% SwStr% in the minors and 31.7 SwStr% in the majors and is located well for an infamously tough pitch to command.","Yesevage slid in the draft compared to where a lot of the draft guys thought he would go and I get it, that arm slot could lead to some shoulder troubles in the future, but he has been dominant enough this season to receive a huge bump in the rankings and I’m a fan of the stuff since he has an effective four pitch mix that generates a near 50% GB rate. The Jays have been pretty safe with him this year as he has rarely surpassed 75 pitches in a game in one of the most impressive workups you will ever see starting in low A and climbing every level of the minors to debut at the end of the season and play a huge role in the playoffs.  I’m a big fan and think he’s for sure a #2 starter on almost any team, but hitters will always get the nod over pitchers which is why he doesn’t end up higher in my rankings.",30,,45/50,40/50,55/60,,,,,,,70/70,,,,55/60,,
4,24,Robby Snelling,SP,Marlins,Early 2026,Jesus Luzardo-light,"The ¾ arm-slot helps create a lot of deception between his fastball and slider, which he repurposed this year  to make the sweeping curve his primary breaker and also improved the change up.  Snelling was only hitting 93 on the fastball last year and dialed it up to 95-97 this year (keep in mind the above data is 2024/2025 combined), we forget how young he was in 2023 when he first broke out.  His change up is also up a couple ticks from 86 mph last year to 88-89 this year.  The sweeper/curve is up to an average of about 83 MPH and that’s what the majority of his Ks seem to come on, while he’s dotting the fastball to an over 60% strike rate (which is ridiculous command) and an over 20% swinging strike rate.","Snelling won Baseball America’s 2023 Minor League Pitcher of the Year; then followed it up with a roller coaster of a 2024 where he was terrible with the Padres until the Marlins acquired him and everything changed.  The improvement was drastic as soon as the Marlins acquired Snelling and then he added velocity in the offseason, while also changing his primary breaker.",26,50/60,60/65,55/60,65/70,,,,,,,,,,,40/45,,
5,26,Jonah Tong,SP,Mets,Debuted,Tim Lincecum,"Tong has some tricky IVB on a sinking mid to high 90s fastball, a big curve that drops right in on hitters from a high over the top arm slot from a smaller 6’ 1”, 180 pound frame.  He also pairs these with a decent back pocket change up and a hard vertical slider to bridge between the fastball and curve.  The command has been pretty steady of late and didn’t falter in his first AAA start, which is a task on its own - Tong has been phenomenal this season with a 1.73 SIERA (JA ERA) prior to his major league promotion.  The fastball grades so well based on ride and in his first AAA start generated a 20% SwStr%.  The changeup is a vulcan grip change up that is pretty nasty with a 25.8% SwStr% in his first AAA start.","His success largely depends on having at least average command of his pitches - which the command issues may be a thing of the past at this point and the biggest concern now is how his shoulder will hold up based on a slight frame and a super over the top arm slot that could lead to injury and the fact that his pitches are primarily north and south, he would benefit from a pitch that breaks east to west if he could develop a sweeper or traditional 2-plane slider.",39,50/60,55/55,40/45,65/65,,,,,,,,,,,40/50,,
6,27,Kade Anderson,SP,Mariners,Mid/Late 2026,Max Fried,"Anderson has an arsenal th at is across the board plus, against some of the other guys in the class that were elite one or two pitches without the full arsenal to do damage, but is a leaner 6’2” lefty that gives me some Max Fried vibes despite needing work on the command.  He has a fastball with up to 20” of vert on it that had the second best whiff% on it in the draft class to Liam Doyle’s fastball, a 2-plane slider, a nasty diving curve and a change up with some nice fade.","Tong gets the edge over Anderson after absolutely dominating the minors, though I do like Anderson’s arsenal, arm-slot and overall package better than Tong as it just seems to be much more traditionally sustainable.  Anderson needs to prove it some in pro ball and once he does should start moving up the rankings.",28,50/60,55/60,45/55,60/60,,,,,,,,,,,55/60,,
7,32,Payton Tolle,SP,Red Sox,Debuted,Young Tarik Skubal light still developing pitches around the fastball,"Tolle has given up some damage, but has been great despite some homer issues earlier in the season.  He’s a huge lefty who gets up to 98 MPH on the fastball with a ridiculous 20.4 SwStr% on it at AAA this year thanks to elite extension (only surpassed by Tyler Glasnow and Logan Gilbert in the majors), he also has a potential above average hard sweeper, a developing potentially plus change up and a solid dropping cutter / arm-side sinker combo off his fastball.","Tolle has a work horse build and should get a ton of run in the Red Sox rotation in 2026 despite not currently being slated for a role.  He’s added a few pitches since the beginning of 2025, adding the necessary hard cutter which was a game changer; while the sinker and curve haven’t worked out as well - but this tells us he will constantly tinker his arsenal and may add or subtract pitches in the offseason.  Anderson gets the edge to Tolle with a more traditional arsenal and delivery, but with how quickly Tolle built up and developed new pitches, it’s not far off.",56,50/60,30/40,55/60,65/70,,,,,,50/55,,,,30/40,45/55,,
8,35,Bubba Chandler,SP,Pirates,Debuted,Luis Gil with a Zach Wheeler slider,"Big fastball and slider guy, known as a dual sport athlete who is not finally focusing on baseball rather than football.  A lot of upside here as he has never been focused only on baseball until a couple years ago; he had committed to Clemson to play QB.  He throws 98-102 MPH with between 18-22” of vertical break, a 12/6 vertical slider and a sick change up with nice fade that tunnels well and against his other two pitches, but he needs to improve the command of the offspeed pitch.  He throws from a 1-2 o’clock over the top arm angle with a smooth action and quick, whippy arm action.","Chandler has been smoked by bad command since June and one has to wonder if this is him partially just being frustrated with not getting the call as of yet after a tremendous start to the year.  The stuff is all there and I believe this is mental more than physical (which can be seen by how well he performed as soon as he was promoted), though there obviously still has to be some concern hence the drop in the rankings as the fastball, while it generates a good number of swings and misses also is hitable.",20,55/65,30/40,40/50,65/70,,,,,,,,,,,50/60,,
9,38,Andrew Painter,SP,Phillies,Early/Mid 2026,"A bigger Jacob deGrom, or a Tyler Glasnow with more control","Painter regularly touches 99 MPH on his fastball, but he hasn’t re-gained the spin on it that he had pre-TJ so it has lost some ride.  Even when I saw him at low A earlier this year, the guys down there were squaring up the fastball.  He has an excellent pitch mix and knows how to throw his changeup and breaking stuff off his fastball, those pitches have more or less returned to form sans some command, but Painter won’t be the same guy without the ride and velocity on the fastball returning to pre-TJ stuff.","Painter has not been nearly as good pre-injury throughout his rehab and when I saw him live, the fastball was pretty hitable, even at 98 MPH.  The command actually looked on-point, which is the aspect of pitching that usually has the worst result post TJ, but the breaking stuff looked sharp with the slider being his most effective pitch, while the cutter and changeup have also been solid.  Painter is still searching for his fastball and has lost a full grade of command, if not more since the TJ - nothing looks elite right now, just solid as the fastball and curve have been getting smashed.  There’s still ace upside in here, but right now he looks more like a #3.",27,55/65,45/50,45/60,45/55,,,,,,55/60,,,,,60/65,,
10,47,Liam Doyle,SP,Cardinals,Late 2026,Tarik Skubal meld with Sonny Gray,"Doyle is best known for a big 100 mph+ fastball from the left side with big time ride along with his bulldog like mentality on the mound, which reminds me of Sonny Gray, as does the high effort / high arm speed delivery.  Doyle also features a splitter and is one of very few lefties that feature a splitter in their arsenal with a ton of dive to it and a nice off-balance pitch to throw against the fastball.  The sweeper could be a bigger weapon with an uptick of velocity, while the cutter is a solid weapon without a ton of break, but enough to make it a weapon up in the zone.","Doyle has top two starter level potential for the Cardinals and his success will largely be dependent upon health and the development of his secondaries as the fastball will be one of the better fastballs in the majors the moment Doyle debuts.  He should be a quick mover and debut by the end of 2026 as long as he can build up to normal workloads and replicate the track some of the other top pitching prospects have taken in recent seasons like Tolle and Yesavage in 2025.  There’s a decent gap in tiers between Painter and Doyle and that’s not based upon pitch level data, but more so based upon the fact that some of the guys in this next tier don’t have as much of a pro track record or data to pull upon.",37,,30/40,45/50,70/70,,,,,,50/50,50/60,,,,50/60,,
11,50,Logan Henderson,SP,Brewers,Debuted (IL),Spencer Strider-light (dude has some quads) mash with Michael Wacha,"Henderson is of slight build (5’ 11”) with excellent command and a nice fastball / changeup combo.  The fastball runs 92-96 MPH with nearly 17” of IVB and 85th MLB percentile run, not to mention a 95th percentile VAA and the change up is one of the better change ups in all of baseball with 99th percentile break and 100th percentile spin.  On a pitch level, Henderson throws the fastball and changeup a combined 80-85% of the time and he needs to throw the cutter and slider (bad command) more often to balance the borderline elite fastball/changeup combo.","I have been one of the bigger Logan Henderson guys for the last year or so when it comes to prospecting.  The cutter is good, Henderson should throw it a little more and then work on developing a better breaking pitch this offseason (sweeper?) to improve the arsenal.  Doyle has better overall stuff than Henderson and funny enough also might pitch more innings this season than Hendreson did.  I likely would have had Henderson up a few more spots had he not gotten hurt.",46,60/70,,60/60,65/65,,,,,,50/55,,,,,35/40,,
12,51,Kyson Witherspoon,SP,Red Sox,Mid 2027,Emmet Sheehan / Nolan McLean mash,"At 6’ 2”, he’s not the biggest pitcher, but I love his fastball coming from the lower release point, it has some electric IVB on it.  The slider is a beast as a vertically cutting slider with similar shape to the aforementioned Sheehan, while his cutter also has some insane vertical movement which is more like a gyro slider in the mold of Nolan McLean’s sweeper with some insane velocity to break, while the curve ball is a slower, deeper break than the slider or cutter.","Witherspoon is one of my favorite players out of this year’s draft - he also has age on his side as one of the younger college guys, but his arsenal is elite and he should develop into a stud #2 starter with health, especially if the command gains last year are maintained.  The fastball will carry him to success no matter what, but the breakers are underrated, if he were bigger or Doyle was a righty, rather than a lefty I would have him over Liam Doyle, it’s a close one for me between these two 2025 draftee starters.",58,40/45,50/55,45/60,65/65,,,,,,55/60,,,,,60/65,,
13,51,Gage Jump,SP,Athletics,Mid 2026,Lean high velo Carlos Rodon,"Jump is a smaller college lefty who is known as a gamer and was drafted in the second round in 2024 out of LSU with a high 90s fastball from the left side (sitting 94-97, but hitting up to 100 mph), with very nice ride when he throw it high in the zone and deception at his release point along with a really slick 2-plane diving slider and a knee breaking 81 mph curve that breaks vertically.  He could be a quick riser as the Athletics aren’t super deep at the higher levels with pitching.  He’s incredibly efficient with his pitches and has run a fantastic 2.57 SIERA (JA ERA) on the season.","Jump has already nailed pitch counts in the 80-90 range, but the Athletics have pulled back on the innings and the pitch count starting around July in an effort to keep him in the 120-130 range.  Henderson is a bit more developed than Jump and gets the edge though Jump does get a small bump for being a lefty with significant velocity and for having better breaking pitches.",56,30/40,40/50,50/60,65/65,,,,,,,,,,,55/60,,
14,53,Jarlin Susana,SP,Nationals,Late 2026,Paul Skenes light,"Susana came to the Nats in the Juan Soto trade from San Diego… the gift trade that keeps on giving.  Susana has an insane 100-102 MPH missile of a fastball, a 88-91 mph nasty power slider that continues to improve and is his best pitch along with a diving, death ball change up with curve like action.  He almost reminds me of a better version of Kumar Rocker.  Susana finished the season incredibly strong with much improved command (only a 10.9% BB rate in his final 7 starts, good for a 39.1 K-BB%) and 0.81 JA ERA.",The Nationals have a pair of ridiculous pitching prospects right now between Susana and Skykora.  Sykora led the minors in fStuff and Susana was third in fStuff.  He has ace level potential if the command gains bleed into next year and he could more or less be the Jacob Misiorowski command resurgence to start level pitcher player of 2026.

He throws from a pretty simple ¾ delivery from the right side and the big upgrade in my ranking is due to the fact we now have pitch level data that is incredibly impressive - impressive enough to defeat my anti-Cubs bias that certainly exists.","Wiggins is kind of a two pitch guy right now relying on the split in movement from the flat fastball to the late break slider for the majority of his strikeouts and the changeup is good enough that he has a solid enough 3-pitch mix, but the issue he has is the lack of command start-to-start, as he will go one or two starts with a 55-60% strike rate and then drop down to a 35-45% strike rate right after.  Wiggins inconsistent command and worse secondaries pushes him under Susana despite having a bit better proximity.",80,55/60,35/40,35/40,65/65,,,,,,,,,,,50/60,,

The breakers need some work developing, but the fastball and changeup combo alone will help him raise quickly through the levels despite his age and with health this is a dude who could debut at 20/21 years-old.","The fastball is ridiculous, good luck to the low A hitters that will have to try to hit that thing, I doubt Hernandez runs into trouble at any level until AAA and he’s in an organization with a lot of great young pitchers that should help him out as he comes up.  High school pitchers are hard to pump in fantasy baseball prospect rankings, he should be higher in non-fantasy related rankings - simply because proximity really matters with pitching prospects as injuries are just a killer for pitchers in fantasy baseball.  Stuff alone, he’s a top 30 prospect for me right now- but the fact we have to go through two-three years of avoiding serious injury before you can use him pushes him down below some proximity guys like Quinn Mathews.",63,55/65,45/55,50/60,,,50/60,,,60/70,,,,,,40/50,,

His command has gone from elite to lost this year, but he has been better of late and has shown himself in college to be a workhorse.","Mathews had a shoulder injury at the beginning of the season that ruined his command and his velocity has been down since last year, but his command has been significantly better since the beginning of August.  I have a feeling most of this has to do with hitters sitting on the high fastball letting ABS do the work for them and forcing him to throw the fastball in the zone or fall behind in the count.  Mathews needs to spend the offseason working on re-gaining some vertical break and command on the fastball to allow his very good secondaries to play up.",38,70/70,50/55,35/55,40/50 - lost velo and command this year,,,,,,,,,,45/55,60/70,,

The cutter is also kind of just a vertical gyro slider, it's just a matter of semantics.","It’s easy to group Jamie Arnold and Hagen Smith together because they have such similar arm-slots from the left side.  Smith has better stuff and more velocity, but Jamie Arnold has much more command and is more polished, so he gets the edge.  He should climb pretty quickly and could even debut by the end of 2026 thanks to his polish, but I see 2027 as more likely and Hernandez gets the bump on him even with the delay of having to wait for him because the stuff and command is ace level on Hernandez, while Arnold profiles more as a #2-3 starter.",N/A,50/55,,55/55,60/60,,,,,,45/50,,,,,65/65,,

He’s working on a changeup / splitter pitch as well to throw against his primarily fastball and slider combo.  He’s run into some command issues this season as his walk rate is at a completely unsustainable 16.3% rate, which is some scary reliever stuff.","I don’t have pitch level data to analyze why his command has been so bad this year, since he’s not at AAA, but I’m not going to quit on him so quickly - so let’s give him some patience, as the fastball / slider combo is obviously ridiculous.  Mechanically though, it makes sense how he could lose command so easily - it’s a very different delivery.

Lagrange is rocking a 2.69 JA ERA (SIERA) and though he has piled up a ton of strikeouts, his biggest killer has been a return of the erratic command in AA that haunted him last year.  He also throws a 2-seamer with arm-side run that has some nice movement and destroys lefties.","Lagrange has been one of the best pitchers in the minors this season and should move up in short order as a 22-year-old.  Lagrange is consistent and going deep into games, running pitch counts regularly in the 90s and has insane stuff.  He sometimes throws a sweeper, but it has almost a curve hook to it and is more vertical than horizontal and needs something that runs east to west to complete the arsenal as well as locking in the command.  His stuff is very good and he could be Misiorowski-esk if he can figure out the command.  I give Hagen Smith the slight edge, because I feel like he’s the easier fix command-wise thanks to Lagrange’s size / more moving parts.",78,30/40,,30/40,60/60,,,,,,,60/65,,,,65/65,,40/40

The fastball runs into the lower/mid-90s with excellent ride to it and he’s good and pounding it into the top of the zone.  He throws a curve against a 12/6 slider, it would be killer if he could add a sweeper to the arsenal or something with more horizontal movement and the change up has some splitter characteristics.","I love Murphy, it’s good to have him back and the command has been sublime since returning from TJ.  The velocity is down a bit, but with the movement there and the command actually improved he should be able to have a normal offseason and could perhaps add some velocity in a pitching lab.

Gibson throws two different fastballs between the four-seamer and the two-seamer (which also sometimes gets labeled as a sinker) and two different sliders (between a sweeper that also gets labeled as a slider, while his gyro slider gets labeled as a cutter).","Gibson is a tunnel master, all of his pitches tunnel together except for the curve ball, but I’m a fan of the fastballs and the two sliders as above average to plus pitches and with better stuff, despite not having the command of Lowder I give Gibson the edge.",N/A,30/40,40/55,45/50,50/55,,,55/60,,,,,,,,60/60,,60/60

He’s been hurt the majority of the year and is slated to get some innings in the Arizona Fall League for a hopefully healthy 2026 season.  The change up could be an elite pitch as it has some dive like a sinker.","Lowder has missed the entire season more or less in 2025 and is supposedly going to be ready to go for the Arizona Fall League.

Knowing the Angels, he will be a quick mover.  The fastball has good velocity, but with lackluster camera angles I’m not entirely convinced of the characteristics, though there does appear to be some run to it, while the change up is about as close to an airbender as you can get with a starter, it’s going to be a dominant pitch.  I actually like the sweeper and despite reports, to me it looks like he has two different sliders, one is a sweeper - the one I like and the other is kind of a spike ball gyro slider, which I think is only average at best.","If Bremner can develop the sweeper I think he goes from being a solid #3 type to a potential front line #1 or #2 guy, the fastball / change up combo alone isn’t enough to get him there and the video I’ve seen of the sweeper make it look like it could be a pretty savage.",N/A,70/70,,35/40,60/60,,,,,,,,,,,40/40,,45/55

He’s a big dude and the majority of the guys in the wider tier of pitching prospects have a bit iffy command, but generally roll big time velocity and I know Wiggins has some pretty numbers, but I think Schlittler has better stuff.",N/A,,45/50,45/50,65/65,,,,,,55/65,,,,50/50,,,50/55

He’s a giant at 6’ 6” with a 44.4% whiff rate in the minors and needs to be up in A+ or AA at this point.  Sykora rocks a mid to high 90s fastball with obviously ridiculous extension due to his size with more run than ride and he also has a devastating low to mid 80s splitter and mid 80s hard vertical slider.  About a month ago it was announced Sykora needed Tommy John surgery and this is what pushed him down the rankings - otherwise he would be an easy top 20-25 prospect.,"This dude is a freak and could be the top prospect when he returns.  The only reason Wiggins and some of these other guys are ahead of Sykora at this point is proximity, so Sykora is a nice breaking point where the pitchers under him are all guys that will still likely debut in a similar or later timeframe despite the TJ or guys that don’t have upper end of the rotation potential.",24,,,40/50,65/70,,,,,,,60/65,,,,55/60,,

Eagen is rocking a 2.46 JA ERA (SIERA) and has a nice four pitch mix with an underrated fastball with a ton of ride and some arm-side movement, a potential plus sweeping slider and a plus diving 12/6 curve.","Eagen has been on a dominant run with 29 strikeouts and 4 walks in his last three starts, including his AA debut where he threw absolute fire.  Eagen has a killer three pitch mix and still has developmental time to add another pitch or a tick or two of velocity.  He’s one of the biggest pitching risers this season and it’s well deserved.  I bumped him ahead of Messick and Rojas when doing final research, as I think the elite fastball, curve, sweeper combo is just a better play long-term than the fastball/change up/kitchen sink play of Messick and because he’s already pitched more innings in one season than Rojas ever has in pro ball.",N/A,30/40,60/65,45/50,60/65,,,,,,,,,,,,,50/60

The gyro slider and splitter play off each other very nicely, he’s a fun pitcher.  Sloan has a 2.76 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season, including having pitched in high A.","Sloan may not have some of the big strikeout numbers that other prospect pitchers ranked lower might have, but the stuff is electric from a high pedigree pitcher in an organization that really knows how to effectively develop starters, especially with this type of arsenal.  Tink gets the edge to sloan because of a superior fastball and the proximity, but with the injury history this is a close matchup.  Eagen gets a slight proximity bump and has movement on his side, while Sloan is the safer bet to be a good #2 starter to help anchor a rotation for a long time.

The fastball has some natural ride and glove-side run as he almost just slings it from his arm-slot and the sweeper against lefties is funny, because guys think they are about to get nailed and flinch at the pitch that lands in the strike zone.   He’s run a 2.84 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season.","Caminiti has shown some impressive stuff and has improved as the season has gone on, especially the sweeper that is becoming a dominant pitch.  The change up has evolved into a splitter with some drop to it that is a nasty change of pace against the fastball and slider. Unlike some of the other young guys, Caminiti's pitch count has been increasing as the season has gone on and he is getting stronger.  Caminiti gets the slight edge to Messick with a much better arsenal overall, he could be a top of the rotation guy, whereas Messick looks like a solid #3-4 starter - but has proximity on his side.

He’s almost a side-armer (Funky slightly under ¾ arm-slot) that is tough to pick up and comes in at 96-98 mph with a crazy 88-90 mph slider.  He’s a bit of a slinger and on some of the breaking pitches, his arm angle and wrist change to try to get the spin he wants which leads to inconsistencies in the delivery and lack of tunneling.  Hopkins is throwing less than 50% strikes per game - he needs to clean up the command to live up to his potential.  The curve ball has good depth on it, but it’s rarely in the zone, while the vertical cutter is just a tighter bridge between his sweeper and fastball.  The arsenal overall is dirty, I love the sinker and sweeper and he has very good extension.","Hopkins has some command issues and I previously have noted he reminds me of a righty version of Cooper Hjerpe (in my prospect to prospect comp) and has posted a 3.28 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season.  He may run into issues in AAA due to the ABS, because his stuff is more likely to generate swings and misses outside of the zone (ala Quinn Mathews) rather than called strikes landing in the zone.  Hopkins vs. Messick is an interesting one, as Messick has way better command, but Hopkins has a much better arsenal overall and does not have the proximity.

He’s been primarily throwing fastball and changeup this season even though his slider and sinker are both very solid pitches, but the change up has become his primary strikeout pitch with a 23.1 SwStr% on the season at AAA, where he has posted a 3.03 JA ERA (SIERA) on the year before the call up.","He’s a bit of a bull dog on the mound and as a command first guy there should be a pretty smooth transition up level and unsurprisingly his walk rate has increased about 2% thanks to the ABS at AAA, but it should bounce back to the 8% range he’s had throughout his entire career in the majors - though it’s been even better in his first two starts in the majors.  Messick doesn’t have the same stuff as Melton, who he is behind or Kendry Rojas (who I have him bumped ahead for durability reasons), but we are at this edge of proximity starting pitchers to high ceiling pitchers who are much further away and as a guy who always logs innings and is in the majors, Messick deserves an edge to guys who may never get to this point because it’s still a long road.",107,65/70,40/50,50/55,40/45,,,,,,,40/45,,,,45/55,,

His dominant splitter is complimented by a mid 90s fastball with a hard slider that also gets a lot of swinging strikes.  The arsenal is further complimented by a vertical gyro slider that he throws as a spike pitch with nice depth and a progressively better curve that acts as his off-tempo pitch.","Wenninger has a great frame and has an aura of being an old school professional pitcher about him.  Wenninger is rocking a 2.89 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season and is coming off a rough three game stretch post All Star, but has come out of it the last couple of starts.  Wenninger is polished and has a work-horse build.  While I think Rojas might have a better arsenal than Wenninger overall since Wenninger lacks a dominant east to west pitch (splitter goes west to east), Wenninger has the durability you want to see in a solid mid-rotation piece - I think he’s a lock for a good #3-#4 starter while Rojas has #2 upside, but could end up in the pen if he can’t build innings.",82,,45/55,50/55,55/55,,,,,,,60/70,,,,45/50,,

He’s an athletic lefty with a snappy delivery from a ¾ arm slot.  His primary fastball is a high run sinker, but his sinking change up (22.6 SwStr%) and slider (20.4 SwStr%) are elite pitches that generate elite swing and miss.  Rojas demonstrates average to plus command from the left side.  The fastball has high potential with up to 19” of IVB, but it’s not nearly as good at generating swing and miss as the sinker.","Rojas fell a bit in my rankings post deadline, as his walk rate has jumped over 8% and the swinging strike rate is down 4% in three starts at AAA for the Twins, though it should be noted the Blue Jays AAA home park factor is 96 and the Twins is 105, so this may play a small role.  Rojas is a plus player across the board without any real elite attributes, but until the trade he was a consistent performer who profiles as a good #3 starter with health (which his maximum innings in pro ball is 84 in 2023).",N/A,55/60,,40/60,45/55,,,,,,,55/60,,,,55/60,,

He has a high IVB fastball at 18” IVB that darts in against a fairly nasty 87-89 mph sweeper, a slower loopier 2-plane knuckle-curve and a very solid change up.  He has a slight build at 6’1” and only about 180 pounds, but has great locations with only a 5.5% walk rate - he puts the ball where he wants it to go.","The Athletics are being cautious with Lin this year, limiting his pitch count to less than 50 pitches since the start of June, hence the lower innings count.  The command has gotten worse at high A, which I would attribute more to the innings count than to his overall command.  Rojas gets the nod to Lin as he’s closer to the majors and while they both have been limited innings-wise this year, Rojas is due to injury while Lin is because it’s his first season in state-side pro ball.",111,50/50,,55/65,55/60,,,,,,,,45/55,,,,,50/60

The video we have on him from high A sucks, so hopefully now that he’s in AA we get better video moving forward (I say that and the early video is from an angle behind the plate - crap).  He went to Tread last year and added a couple ticks to his fastball, sitting 94-95 with nice ride on the four seamer, then he throws a sinker with good ride to it to throw hitters off balance.  His best secondary is a nasty vertical sweeper, but he also has a gyro slider type spike curve ball / AKA “death ball” that was developed at Tread.  He also developed a nasty kick change at Tread (which has more negative vert like a splitter) against his traditional change up.  He’s a true pitcher that loves his craft, which is why he’s so good - rather than a thrower pounding velocity.","Forret might be one of the most underrated starters in the minors and a partial explanation is he hasn’t had many ridiculous strikeout games with elite numbers, but is just steadily, consistently good each time out.  He also has been getting capped around 75 pitches per game, which is limiting his innings and inability to pile up strikeouts, but he is rocking a 2.18 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season.

Hill was extremely impressive and I see a lot of good starters in the Florida State League.  Watching him reminded me of Shane McClanahan at first, but the movement on the primary fastball is completely different and upon second consideration his profile is more of the Max Fried type.  Hill should scrap throwing the sinker so much and throw the four seamer and curve more.  His command has been getting worse as the season has gone on and the Twins are babying him.

Those two pitches are a fun combo that keep hitters off balance, because they tunnel so well together.  The slider isn’t high velo, but it does have a lot of sweeping movement to it across the zone, while the curve almost looks like a slow traditional slider with two-plane break at almost 10 to 4 o’clock with a 22.6 SwStr% at A ball.  King has a 2.58 JA ERA (SIERA) on the year.","King is another guy I’ve seen live this year, catching the first low A start of his career.  The change up is an underrated pitch with a lot of room to run and at only 19-years-old you know he will be adding velocity as he develops.

The stuff is all north/south except the splitter and he needs a pitch that can effectively break east to west to perfect the arsenal.,"Perales was off my rankings list last time around since he had to get Tommy John surgery last year, but he began a throwing program in early May and has still yet to return, so it appears the Red Sox are being overly cautious, which is concerning to me and helps to explain the rankings drop, though there is new video of him throwing 98 mph.

He has a lower, ¾ arm-slot that provides for a lot of ride on the fastball, which is his best pitch.  There is some relief risk with Fuentes since he’s a primary two pitch guy as he needs to develop at least one more pitch that can go east/west, maybe a sinker - he’s still very young so there is a lot of time to develop without rushing him to the majors again.  The curve has two-plane break and nice depth, but needs work on spotting locations.","Fuentes was placed on the IL at the beginning of the month with an unspecified injury and has yet to return.  I’m sure rushing him between all levels of the entire organization was not great for his health and hopefully it’s not an arm issue keeping him out.

He has had some ridiculously bad luck with a .406 BABIP against this year and .411 at AA (which must have the worst defense in baseball) against a 3.01 JA ERA (SIERA) this year.

The dude is a horse throwing 80+ pitches most times out in an era where those types of pitchers are fewer and fewer.  Hess has a 2.70 JA ERA (SIERA) this season and has an above average arsenal playing on a plus fastball, which should ultimately result in a good #3-4 starter.

Wood also throws a tight gyro slider / death ball, but has gone on the record saying he may replace that pitch in his arsenal with something else.","There’s some thought Wood could come up in the pen for the Phillies for the playoff run, but he has not yet pitched at pro ball.  Wood had an injury shortened season after a shoulder issue and had spent previous seasons in the pen.  Wood is likely to develop some additional secondaries around the fastball and curve now that he’s in pro ball, it will be fun to watch, because those two pitches are ridiculous, if he can get a slider or sweeper with horizontal break and pair that with a good splitter or change up, watch out!

The curve is pretty much a slower version of his slider with a very similar break and he started throwing a sinker this year that has some nice horizontal break to it, but has not had the chance to develop due to the injuries.","The big question about Tink has always been durability as a smaller stature for a starter at 6’ 1”, he can build up and maintain his electric stuff deeper into games. He showed in May of 2024 he can consistently pitch into the sixth and seventh innings, but injuries since then have slowed him down.  I made the note last year that hopefully he’s not the next Alex Reyes, but at this point there might be a 40-50% chance he ends up in the pen, rather than as a starter and if he does, he could be electric, because the stuff is great.  Here’s a quandary, Tink is better than Nichols per inning, but Nichols is a workhorse; while Tink and Clarke have pretty similar innings / buildup problems, however Tink has much better command than Clarke and gets the nod.",98,60/65,40/50,40/50,55/65,,,,,,,35/40,,,,55/60,,
48,143,Brandon Clarke,SP,Red Sox,Mid 2026,Robbie Ray with higher velocity,"Clarke is a big lefty drafted in the fifth round who didn’t pitch last year and has had insanely ridiculous numbers since his debut.  This is a name that should be on everyone’s list this year - he should be a quick riser.  He hits 100 mph from the left side (lives around 96-97); though the pitch lacks significant vertical break and a ridiculously nasty horizontal sweeper against an even sharper 2/8 gyro slider that is effective against righties and lefties, plus a change with nice movement, but poor placement.  Clarke is also phenomenal at getting groundouts, with a 63.9% GB rate on the year.","The sweeper / slider combo is downright dirty as the gyro slider bridges the fastball and sweeper.  The Red Sox drafted this guy out of local college in Florida (State College of Florida Manatee - Sarasota) in one of the best finds in recent memory, reminiscent of when the White Sox found Chris Sale at Florida Gulf Coast.  Clarke has been pretty bad since the All Star Break, despite still posting a 2.97 JA ERA (SIERA) entirely thanks to atrocious command.  His stuff is insane, but there is major bullpen risk here.",67,40/45,,20/40,60/60,,,,,,,,,,,60/65,,55/60
49,144,David Davalillo,SP,Rangers,Late 2026,Bryan Bello / Reese Olson mash,"Davalillo led the minors in ERA last season and is pacing to be a competitor again this season.  He’s a shorter 6’1” righty of slight build that throws two fastballs (with the 2-seamer as a better pitch than the 4-seamer), but has some killer breaking pitches between a sharp vertical gryo slider / cutter, a beast of a split changeup and a big vertical breaking curve (a slow curve and a sweeper with similar depth, but quicker break) and generates a ton of ground balls along with the Ks.  He’s a groundball machine with a 48.8% GB rate.","Davalillo is smoking guys at the lower levels with his movement, but without the killer fastball or dominant foundational pitch, I do have some concerns about how his stuff might play or how his strikeouts might downtick against higher levels of competition - though he does have a nice kitchen sink approach and is already proven to be a pitcher, not a thrower.  I wouldn’t say he has any particular elite pitch, but he’s a smart pitcher that knows how to use what he has to be effective.  Davalillo has a 2.63 JA ERA (SIERA) on the year and is having a bit of a rough time translating to AA.",144,,50/55,55/60,45/50 [50/50 on 2 seam],,,,,,55/55,50/55,,,,,,50/55
50,145,Santiago Suarez,SP,Rays,Late 2027,Freddy Peralta light,"Suarez is a command first pitcher with a 93-97 MPH fastball featured by some decent ride and a changeup with some split characteristics, along with a nice cutter / slider combo.  He’s a big righty at only 6’ 2” and has gained a couple ticks of velocity since he was on this list a year ago.  Suarez uses the cutter / gyro slider that breaks horizontally against righties and the changeup against lefties, while the slider has a 1/7 vertical break to it and might also be registered as a power curve.","Suarez has missed a good chunk of the year due to a triceps / shoulder injury, which has affected his ranking from the last update, but he’s back now and has a 2.27 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season, despite having some odd reverse split issues as righties have a .784 OPS against him and lefties only have a .360 OPS, because he throws the changeup against righties outside of the zone and has to rely on the cutter and slider for righties.  Clarke and Suarez are almost opposites because Suarez is kind of ho-hum with great command vs. Clarke’s 100 mph from the left side.  I’ll go Clarke for now as Suarez is still rebounding from injury and pitching injuries are scary.  Suarez and Davalillo are a bit similar, except Davalillo has a better track record of health and more pitches to draw on.",114,40/45,,60/70,55/55,,,,,,50/50,,,,,55/55,,
51,147,Bryce Cunningham,SP,Yankees,Early 2027,Lucas Giolito / Luis Castillo mash,"Cunningham is a big dude at 6’5” and 230 pounds and has a mid 90s fastball that tops out at 97 with ride high in the zone, a plus change up with a good amount of arm-side run, a sub par gyro slider and a brand new 1/7 curveball.  He also has plus command of the zone and is already built to throw 90 plus pitches each time out.","Cunningham has the pedigree and build to move through the minors fast pending health, especially since he’s already built up.  The fastball and change was proven by Logan Henderson to work at the next level, but obviously if he can continue to develop one of the breakers, then we are really talking. Cunningham spent a good amount of time on the IL and just returned for three baby starts so far and has gotten knocked around a bit, he doesn’t quite look the same - but I won’t hold it too much against him.  I like the stuff better than what Suarez and Davalillo have in their pockets, but he doesn’t have the same consistency or pitchability yet and needs to develop that part of his game or improve the breakers to get there - as even the 3.22 JA ERA (SIERA) will tell us.",142,60/65,45/50,45/55,60/60,,,,,,,,,,,40/45,,
52,149,Elmer Rodriguez-Cruz,SP,Yankees,Late 2026,,"Rodriguez-Cruz was my 6th man in my last rankings update, but the lanky righty has pushed his way onto the list this time around after some big velo gains after moving from the Red Sox to the Yankees.  He’s a lot of legs coming at you from a ¾ arm-slot, which may cause some deception.  He has five pitches that all play off each other without a traditional fastball, which is strange.  The sinker has some ridiculous movement, but I think it would ultimately play better with a four seamer that has some ride to play off of it, rather than just the change up which has the same break as the sinker, except slower.  The cutter and curve play off each other as the cutter has a nice 12/6 movement profile, just like the curve - which is kind of vanilla.  He also has a gyro slider, which is sometimes now melded with a cutter that has a tight 2-plane break to it and is interesting because most gyro sliders are just a cutter at this point.  It has some nice movement, but he can leave it hanging sometimes.","ERC has some interesting stuff, but the lack of a setup traditional four seamer is a bit concerning to me.  He has posted 3.05 JA ERA (SIERA) in AA and has been better than Cunningham this year, who is a level lower - but Cunningham has a very good fastball / slider combo that I think pushes him to higher top of the rotation potential whereas ERC has a kitchen sink, middle of the rotation arsenal.",151,50/55,40/45,40/45,,,,,,,45/50,,,,60/65,45/55,,
