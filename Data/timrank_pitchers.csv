0,3,Chase Burns,SP,Reds,Debuted,Hunter Greene / Dylan Cease mash up,"Insane fastball / slider combo that could be one of the best in baseball. Burns just went on the IL with a flexor strain, but the Reds had already been talking about limiting the workload and it sounds like he avoided a serious injury and could be throwing again shortly, though word is he may not come back this season still as a precaution. The fastball / slider combo is downright dirty for Burns, by major league Stuff+ he has the fifth best fastball in baseball, a top 10 sinker (he’s only thrown 4, all above 100 mph) and the fourth best slider in baseball.","Burns is putting up some ridiculous numbers through his debut and had a successful climb through the minors reminiscent of Paul Skenes. Burns is slated as a top 10 dynasty starter for me and a top 15 re-draft starter. While there are a number of pitching prospects I like, none have the elite stuff of Chase Burns.",5,45/50,40/40,50/55,70/70,,,,,,,,,,,70/80,,,Y
1,8,Nolan McLean,SP,Mets,Debuted,Tanner Bibee / Luis Severino mash,"McLean is focusing on pitching for the first year of his minor league career and we are seeing an uptick in the effectiveness of his stuff. His arsenal includes a mediocre mid 90s fastball (that tops out at 98), a potential elite late breaking vertical sweeper with a unique hard cut at the tail end of the pitch with a sinker that sits in the mid 90s and had a 75% GB% in AAA along with an 88-90 mph cutter with slider break, an 85-88 mph changeup and a low 80s big hooking curve that is his best swing and miss pitch.","McLean has improved as he has climbed the ranks with each outing even into the majors where he has gotten even better by using his expanded arsenal rather than one or two elite pitches to go from a thrower with interesting stuff to a high end pitcher with a phenomenal approach, but lacks the elite level pitches of Chase Burns.",41,50/55,65/70,55/60,55/65,,,,,,60/65,,,,60/65,,50/55,,Y
2,15,Thomas White,SP,Marlins,Mid/Late 2026,Carlos Rodon Arsenal / Big Nick Lodolo Mechanics mash up,"White is a big 6’ 5” lefty who I saw live both in A ball last year and in the Spring Breakout game this spring with noticeable differences in his repertoire that has made his stuff very impressive, while he needs to work on harnessing the command. He throws from an under ¾ arm-slot, though not quite side-arm and has some ridiculous stuff. Over the last season the fastball added about an inch of horizontal run to it while maintaining velocity. He also added a sweeper to the arsenal against a vertical gyro slider, while his old slider was almost a slurve with a lot of loop at a slower 80 mph. The new duel slider combo was not super effective in the limited 2025 data we have through only two AAA starts and it’s important to know when referencing the above data the slider will be skewed as its combining the 2024 slurve version of the pitch with the 2025 hard vertical gyro version of the pitch into one data set. The sweeper is only a 2025 pitch with a great 2-plane movement profile and more velocity than the old slurve.","White is my top non-debuted starter at this point in time and it will be interesting to see how quickly the Marlins move him this year. I would assume he spends the majority of the year at AAA and he possibly comes up around the trade deadline or in September, but if the Marlins wanted to push some chips in this year he and Snelling could both be up early in an attempt to actually win some ball games this year. The command could lead to some bad games from White, but I think the stuff is so good the higher walk rate won’t overly affect him and we could ultimately get some Dylan Cease like outcomes from the left side.",17,55/60,,35/45,60/65,,,,,,,,,,,50/55,65/70,,Y
3,18,Trey Yesavage,SP,Blue Jays,Debuted,Righty Clayton Kershaw light w/ a splitter,"Big righty with a super over-the-top trebuchet like delivery that throws a solid fastball, slider, cutter and changeup combo. Yesavage has an above average 13.2 SwStr% on the fastball with a ridiculous 12.1” of vertical break (not including gravity), but his most impressive pitch is the slider (also sometimes labeled a cutter due to its tight break) which has a 29.2 SwStr% on the season in the minors and a 16.2 SwStr% in the majors. The splitter had an insane 34.1% SwStr% in the minors and 31.7 SwStr% in the majors and is located well for an infamously tough pitch to command.","Yesevage slid in the draft compared to where a lot of the draft guys thought he would go and I get it, that arm slot could lead to some shoulder troubles in the future, but he has been dominant enough this season to receive a huge bump in the rankings and I’m a fan of the stuff since he has an effective four pitch mix that generates a near 50% GB rate. The Jays have been pretty safe with him this year as he has rarely surpassed 75 pitches in a game in one of the most impressive workups you will ever see starting in low A and climbing every level of the minors to debut at the end of the season and play a huge role in the playoffs. I’m a big fan and think he’s for sure a #2 starter on almost any team, but hitters will always get the nod over pitchers which is why he doesn’t end up higher in my rankings.",30,,45/50,40/50,55/60,,,,,,,70/70,,,,55/60,,,Y
4,24,Robby Snelling,SP,Marlins,Early 2026,Jesus Luzardo-light,"The ¾ arm-slot helps create a lot of deception between his fastball and slider, which he repurposed this year to make the sweeping curve his primary breaker and also improved the change up. Snelling was only hitting 93 on the fastball last year and dialed it up to 95-97 this year (keep in mind the above data is 2024/2025 combined), we forget how young he was in 2023 when he first broke out. His change up is also up a couple ticks from 86 mph last year to 88-89 this year. The sweeper/curve is up to an average of about 83 MPH and that’s what the majority of his Ks seem to come on, while he’s dotting the fastball to an over 60% strike rate (which is ridiculous command) and an over 20% swinging strike rate.","Snelling won Baseball America’s 2023 Minor League Pitcher of the Year; then followed it up with a roller coaster of a 2024 where he was terrible with the Padres until the Marlins acquired him and everything changed. The improvement was drastic as soon as the Marlins acquired Snelling and then he added velocity in the offseason, while also changing his primary breaker.",26,50/60,60/65,55/60,65/70,,,,,,,,,,,40/45,,,Y
5,26,Jonah Tong,SP,Mets,Debuted,Tim Lincecum,"Tong has some tricky IVB on a sinking mid to high 90s fastball, a big curve that drops right in on hitters from a high over the top arm slot from a smaller 6’ 1”, 180 pound frame. He also pairs these with a decent back pocket change up and a hard vertical slider to bridge between the fastball and curve. The command has been pretty steady of late and didn’t falter in his first AAA start, which is a task on its own - Tong has been phenomenal this season with a 1.73 SIERA (JA ERA) prior to his major league promotion. The fastball grades so well based on ride and in his first AAA start generated a 20% SwStr%. The changeup is a vulcan grip change up that is pretty nasty with a 25.8% SwStr% in his first AAA start.","His success largely depends on having at least average command of his pitches - which the command issues may be a thing of the past at this point and the biggest concern now is how his shoulder will hold up based on a slight frame and a super over the top arm slot that could lead to injury and the fact that his pitches are primarily north and south, he would benefit from a pitch that breaks east to west if he could develop a sweeper or traditional 2-plane slider.",39,50/60,55/55,40/45,65/65,,,,,,,,,,,40/50,,,Y
6,27,Kade Anderson,SP,Mariners,Mid/Late 2026,Max Fried,"Anderson has an arsenal th at is across the board plus, against some of the other guys in the class that were elite one or two pitches without the full arsenal to do damage, but is a leaner 6’2” lefty that gives me some Max Fried vibes despite needing work on the command. He has a fastball with up to 20” of vert on it that had the second best whiff% on it in the draft class to Liam Doyle’s fastball, a 2-plane slider, a nasty diving curve and a change up with some nice fade.","Tong gets the edge over Anderson after absolutely dominating the minors, though I do like Anderson’s arsenal, arm-slot and overall package better than Tong as it just seems to be much more traditionally sustainable. Anderson needs to prove it some in pro ball and once he does should start moving up the rankings.",28,50/60,55/60,45/55,60/60,,,,,,,,,,,55/60,,,N
7,32,Payton Tolle,SP,Red Sox,Debuted,Young Tarik Skubal light still developing pitches around the fastball,"Tolle has given up some damage, but has been great despite some homer issues earlier in the season. He’s a huge lefty who gets up to 98 MPH on the fastball with a ridiculous 20.4 SwStr% on it at AAA this year thanks to elite extension (only surpassed by Tyler Glasnow and Logan Gilbert in the majors), he also has a potential above average hard sweeper, a developing potentially plus change up and a solid dropping cutter / arm-side sinker combo off his fastball.","Tolle has a work horse build and should get a ton of run in the Red Sox rotation in 2026 despite not currently being slated for a role. He’s added a few pitches since the beginning of 2025, adding the necessary hard cutter which was a game changer; while the sinker and curve haven’t worked out as well - but this tells us he will constantly tinker his arsenal and may add or subtract pitches in the offseason. Anderson gets the edge to Tolle with a more traditional arsenal and delivery, but with how quickly Tolle built up and developed new pitches, it’s not far off.",56,50/60,30/40,55/60,65/70,,,,,,50/55,,,,30/40,45/55,,,Y
8,35,Bubba Chandler,SP,Pirates,Debuted,Luis Gil with a Zach Wheeler slider,"Big fastball and slider guy, known as a dual sport athlete who is not finally focusing on baseball rather than football. A lot of upside here as he has never been focused only on baseball until a couple years ago; he had committed to Clemson to play QB. He throws 98-102 MPH with between 18-22” of vertical break, a 12/6 vertical slider and a sick change up with nice fade that tunnels well and against his other two pitches, but he needs to improve the command of the offspeed pitch. He throws from a 1-2 o’clock over the top arm angle with a smooth action and quick, whippy arm action.","Chandler has been smoked by bad command since June and one has to wonder if this is him partially just being frustrated with not getting the call as of yet after a tremendous start to the year. The stuff is all there and I believe this is mental more than physical (which can be seen by how well he performed as soon as he was promoted), though there obviously still has to be some concern hence the drop in the rankings as the fastball, while it generates a good number of swings and misses also is hitable.",20,55/65,30/40,40/50,65/70,,,,,,,,,,,50/60,,,Y
9,38,Andrew Painter,SP,Phillies,Early/Mid 2026,"A bigger Jacob deGrom, or a Tyler Glasnow with more control","Painter regularly touches 99 MPH on his fastball, but he hasn’t re-gained the spin on it that he had pre-TJ so it has lost some ride. Even when I saw him at low A earlier this year, the guys down there were squaring up the fastball. He has an excellent pitch mix and knows how to throw his changeup and breaking stuff off his fastball, those pitches have more or less returned to form sans some command, but Painter won’t be the same guy without the ride and velocity on the fastball returning to pre-TJ stuff.","Painter has not been nearly as good pre-injury throughout his rehab and when I saw him live, the fastball was pretty hitable, even at 98 MPH. The command actually looked on-point, which is the aspect of pitching that usually has the worst result post TJ, but the breaking stuff looked sharp with the slider being his most effective pitch, while the cutter and changeup have also been solid. Painter is still searching for his fastball and has lost a full grade of command, if not more since the TJ - nothing looks elite right now, just solid as the fastball and curve have been getting smashed. There’s still ace upside in here, but right now he looks more like a #3.",27,55/65,45/50,45/60,45/55,,,,,,55/60,,,,,60/65,,,Y
10,47,Liam Doyle,SP,Cardinals,Late 2026,Tarik Skubal meld with Sonny Gray,"Doyle is best known for a big 100 mph+ fastball from the left side with big time ride along with his bulldog like mentality on the mound, which reminds me of Sonny Gray, as does the high effort / high arm speed delivery. Doyle also features a splitter and is one of very few lefties that feature a splitter in their arsenal with a ton of dive to it and a nice off-balance pitch to throw against the fastball. The sweeper could be a bigger weapon with an uptick of velocity, while the cutter is a solid weapon without a ton of break, but enough to make it a weapon up in the zone.","Doyle has top two starter level potential for the Cardinals and his success will largely be dependent upon health and the development of his secondaries as the fastball will be one of the better fastballs in the majors the moment Doyle debuts. He should be a quick mover and debut by the end of 2026 as long as he can build up to normal workloads and replicate the track some of the other top pitching prospects have taken in recent seasons like Tolle and Yesavage in 2025. There’s a decent gap in tiers between Painter and Doyle and that’s not based upon pitch level data, but more so based upon the fact that some of the guys in this next tier don’t have as much of a pro track record or data to pull upon.",37,,30/40,45/50,70/70,,,,,,50/50,50/60,,,,50/60,,,Y
11,51,Kyson Witherspoon,SP,Red Sox,Mid 2027,Emmet Sheehan / Nolan McLean mash,"At 6’ 2”, he’s not the biggest pitcher, but I love his fastball coming from the lower release point, it has some electric IVB on it. The slider is a beast as a vertically cutting slider with similar shape to the aforementioned Sheehan, while his cutter also has some insane vertical movement which is more like a gyro slider in the mold of Nolan McLean’s sweeper with some insane velocity to break, while the curve ball is a slower, deeper break than the slider or cutter.","Witherspoon is one of my favorite players out of this year’s draft - he also has age on his side as one of the younger college guys, but his arsenal is elite and he should develop into a stud #2 starter with health, especially if the command gains last year are maintained. The fastball will carry him to success no matter what, but the breakers are underrated, if he were bigger or Doyle was a righty, rather than a lefty I would have him over Liam Doyle, it’s a close one for me between these two 2025 draftee starters.",58,40/45,50/55,45/60,65/65,,,,,,55/60,,,,,60/65,,,N
12,53,Jarlin Susana,SP,Nationals,Late 2026,Paul Skenes light w/ worse command,"Susana came to the Nats in the Juan Soto trade from San Diego… the gift trade that keeps on giving. Susana has an insane 100-102 MPH missile of a fastball, a 88-91 mph nasty power slider that continues to improve and is his best pitch along with a diving, death ball change up with curve like action. He almost reminds me of a better version of Kumar Rocker. Susana finished the season incredibly strong with much improved command (only a 10.9% BB rate in his final 7 starts, good for a 39.1 K-BB%) and 0.81 JA ERA.",The Nationals have a pair of ridiculous pitching prospects right now between Susana and Skykora. Sykora led the minors in fStuff and Susana was third in fStuff. He has ace level potential if the command gains bleed into next year and he could more or less be the Jacob Misiorowski command resurgence to start level pitcher player of 2026.

13,54,Jaxon Wiggins,SP,Cubs,Mid 2026,Max Scherzer-ish,"Wiggins has a big flat fastball with a decent amount of arm-side run that lives in the high 90s, but tops out at 100 with a leaning plus late break gyro slider from a huge 6’6” frame, but some rough control (59% ball rate in AAA) and a plus change up. He throws from a pretty simple ¾ delivery from the right side and the big upgrade in my ranking is due to the fact we now have pitch level data that is incredibly impressive - impressive enough to defeat my anti-Cubs bias that certainly exists.","Wiggins is kind of a two pitch guy right now relying on the split in movement from the flat fastball to the late break slider for the majority of his strikeouts and the changeup is good enough that he has a solid enough 3-pitch mix, but the issue he has is the lack of command start-to-start, as he will go one or two starts with a 55-60% strike rate and then drop down to a 35-45% strike rate right after. Wiggins inconsistent command and worse secondaries pushes him under Susana despite having a bit better proximity.",80,55/60,35/40,35/40,65/65,,,,,,,,,,,50/60,,,Y

The gyro slider and splitter play off each other very nicely, he’s a fun pitcher. Sloan has a 2.76 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season, including having pitched in high A.","Sloan may not have some of the big strikeout numbers that other prospect pitchers ranked lower might have, but the stuff is electric from a high pedigree pitcher in an organization that really knows how to effectively develop starters, especially with this type of arsenal. Wiggins only gets the edge to Sloan because of proximity, but I think Sloan becomes ultimately the better long-term pitcher between the two. He was one of my favorite guys from last year’s draft and Hernandez has a higher fastball upside, but Sloan is one of my favorite pitchers in the minors and unless an injury occurs, he’s a fairly safe bet to be a great #2 starter for a long time.

The breakers need some work developing, but the fastball and changeup combo alone will help him raise quickly through the levels despite his age and with health this is a dude who could debut at 20/21 years-old.","The fastball is ridiculous, good luck to the low A hitters that will have to try to hit that thing, I doubt Hernandez runs into trouble at any level until AAA and he’s in an organization with a lot of great young pitchers that should help him out as he comes up. High school pitchers are hard to pump in fantasy baseball prospect rankings, he should be higher in non-fantasy related rankings - simply because proximity really matters with pitching prospects as injuries are just a killer for pitchers in fantasy baseball. Stuff alone, he’s a top 30 prospect for me right now- but the fact we have to go through two-three years of avoiding serious injury before you can use him pushes him down below some proximity guys with good stuff, but worse command.

He can paint with his fastball, which is an excellent setup pitch, while the sinker adds a few inches of additional horizontal movement to keep hitters off balance and the change up almost plays like a gyro slider as it falls off the plate vertically and the curve has two plane classic slider / slurve like break at high velocity.","Early may not end up being a high strikeout ace in the future, but he has very good #2 - #3 starter stuff who should be good at preventing runs and preventing too many base runners. If he can fully develop the new sweeper, watch out we could have a pop up assassin on our hands. Sloan and Hernandez get the edge for having better fastballs, but Early should not be discounted, the debut of the sweeper since my last rankings update has been a game changer.",151,50/55,55/55,55/60,55/60,,,,,,,,,,60/60,40/40,60/70,,Y

The fastball runs 92-96 MPH with nearly 17” of IVB and 85th MLB percentile run, not to mention a 95th percentile VAA and the change up is one of the better change ups in all of baseball with 99th percentile break and 100th percentile spin. On a pitch level, Henderson throws the fastball and changeup a combined 80-85% of the time and he needs to throw the cutter and slider (bad command) more often to balance the borderline elite fastball/changeup combo. Henderson throws a sinker as well, but he barely throws it so I don’t even grade it below.","I have been one of the bigger Logan Henderson guys for the last year or so when it comes to prospecting. The cutter is good, Henderson should throw it a little more and then work on developing a better breaking pitch this offseason (sweeper?) to improve the arsenal. Henderson’s biggest problem and why I dropped him in the rankings is his lack of durability. Henderson only pitched 103 innings in 2025 and that has been the most of his career, thus he might max out at only 120-140 innings next year.",46,60/70,,60/60,65/65,,,,,,45/55,,,,,35/40,,,Y

The cutter is also kind of just a vertical gyro slider, it's just a matter of semantics.","It’s easy to group Jamie Arnold and Hagen Smith together because they have such similar arm-slots from the left side. Smith has better stuff and more velocity, but Jamie Arnold has much more command and is more polished, so he gets the edge. He should climb pretty quickly and could even debut by the end of 2026 thanks to his polish, but I see 2027 as more likely and Hernandez gets the bump on him even with the delay of having to wait for him because the stuff and command is ace level on Hernandez, while Arnold profiles more as a #2-3 starter.",67,50/55,,55/55,60/60,,,,,,45/50,,,,,65/65,,,N

Lagrange piled up a ton of strikeouts in 2025, but his biggest killer has been a return of the erratic command in AA that haunted him last year. He also throws a 2-seamer with arm-side run that has some nice movement and destroys lefties.","Lagrange has been one of the best pitchers in the minors this season and should move up in short order as a 22-year-old. Lagrange is consistent and going deep into games, running pitch counts regularly in the 90s and has insane stuff. He sometimes throws a sweeper, but it has almost a curve hook to it and is more vertical than horizontal and needs something that runs east to west to complete the arsenal as well as locking in the command. His stuff is very good and he could be Misiorowski-esk if he can figure out the command, which comes and goes and is not consistent in the least.",73,30/40,,30/40,60/60,,,,,,,65/70,,,,65/65,40/40,,Y

He could be a quick riser as the Athletics aren’t super deep at the higher levels with pitching. He’s incredibly efficient with his pitches and has run a fantastic 2.86 SIERA (JA ERA) on the season, but slowed down a bit in the second half only throwing an average of about 60 pitches per start after July.","Jump has already nailed pitch counts in the 80-90 range, but the Athletics have pulled back on the innings and the pitch count starting around July in an effort to keep him in the 120-130 range. I’m looking forward to getting some arsenal level data when he’s at AAA next year and as of now the biggest concerns to me are durability and the fact he will be pitching in a big time hitters park once he’s promoted.",51,30/40,40/50,50/60,65/65,,,,,,,,,,,55/60,,,Y

The stuff is all north/south except the splitter and he needs a pitch that can effectively break east to west to perfect the arsenal.,"Perales just returned from Tommy John surgery and made it back for the Arizona Fall League where he led all pitchers in Stuff+. Perales has very high upside with killer stuff and coming off the significant injury should hopefully have wind in his sails healthwise moving forward. He has top of the rotation upside and if he proves healthy, he could make an impact on the big league team down the stretch in 2026. He gets the edge to Daniel Eagen as he has a phenomenal fastball that sets up some other great pitches and I expect the command to return as he recovers from TJ.",122,,,30/50,60/70,,,,,,,60/65,,,,50/60,40/45,,Y

He’s a giant at 6’ 6” with a 44.4% whiff rate in the minors and needs to be up in A+ or AA at this point. Sykora rocks a mid to high 90s fastball with obviously ridiculous extension due to his size with more run than ride and he also has a devastating low to mid 80s splitter and mid 80s hard vertical slider. Sykora led all minor league pitchers in fStuff and would easily be a top 10 prospect had he not undergone Tommy John surgery in August.,"This dude is a freak and could be the top prospect when he returns. The only reason Wiggins and some of these other guys are ahead of Sykora at this point is proximity, so Sykora is a nice breaking point where the pitchers under him are all guys that will still likely debut in a similar or later timeframe despite the TJ or guys that don’t have upper end of the rotation potential.",81,,,40/50,65/70,,,,,,,60/65,,,,55/60,,,Y
23,77,Tyler Bremner,SP,Angels,Mid/Late 2026,Sandy Alcantara,"Bremner has a high effort ¾ arm-slot delivery and features a primary fastball / changeup combo with work needed on the breakers. Knowing the Angels, he will be a quick mover. The fastball has good velocity, but with lackluster camera angles I’m not entirely convinced of the characteristics, though there does appear to be some run to it, while the change up is about as close to an airbender as you can get with a starter, it’s going to be a dominant pitch. I actually like the sweeper and despite reports, to me it looks like he has two different sliders, one is a sweeper - the one I like and the other is kind of a spike ball gyro slider, which I think is only average at best.","If Bremner can develop the sweeper I think he goes from being a solid #3 type to a potential front line #1 or #2 guy, the fastball / change up combo alone isn’t enough to get him there and the video I’ve seen of the sweeper makes it look like it could be pretty savage. He should be a quick mover up levels once he debuts the way the Angels promote, but he seems like a #2 starter more than an ace type and thus I’ll wait the year for Sykora ver Bremner.",N/A,70/70,,35/40,60/60,,,,,,,,,,,40/40,45/55,,N

Eagen slowed down after his last three starts and as Doc is always repeating on the Prospect Warehouse Podcast is a brain cancer survivor, but other than narrative street he has a nice four pitch mix with an underrated mid 90s fastball with a ton of ride and some arm-side movement, a potential plus sweeping slider and a plus diving 12/6 curve.","Eagen’s K rate dropped significantly through his first four AA starts, so there was a bit of a bump in the road upon promotion we need to watch. Eagen has a killer three pitch mix and still has developmental time to add another pitch or a tick or two of velocity. He’s one of the biggest pitching risers this season and it’s well deserved. Eagen vs. Murphy is an interesting one, but with Murphy coming off Tommy John and Eagen having a nice track record of putting up a large number of innings, Eagen gets the nod.",89,30/40,60/65,45/50,60/65,,,,,,,,,,,,50/60,,Y

The fastball runs into the lower/mid-90s with excellent ride to it and he’s good and pounding it into the top of the zone. He throws a curve against a 12/6 slider, it would be killer if he could add a sweeper to the arsenal or something with more horizontal movement and the change up has some splitter characteristics.","I love Murphy, it’s good to have him back and the command has been sublime since returning from TJ. The velocity is down a bit, but with the movement there and the command actually improved he should be able to have a normal offseason and could perhaps add some velocity in a pitching lab. Eagen gets the edge to Murphy just because he has more velocity and size in the tank, though it’s close because Murphy’s fastball will be dominant despite pitching at a lower velocity.",75,40/45,55/60,60/65,60/65,,,,,,,,,,,60/65,,,Y

He’s working on a changeup / splitter pitch as well to throw against his primarily fastball and slider combo. His biggest issue to date has been command, but a strong showing in the Arizona Fall League in 2025 gives us some hope as he had 21 strikeouts and only 6 walks in 14 innings.","I don’t have pitch level data to analyze why his command has been so bad this year, since he’s not at AAA, but I’m not going to quit on him so quickly - so let’s give him some patience, as the fastball / slider combo is obviously ridiculous. Mechanically though, it makes sense how he could lose command so easily - it’s a very different delivery. It’s interesting he dropped in my rankings despite a successful Arizona Fall League, which I would put more on me liking a few more hitters and bumping them than me moving him within my pitching rankings. Smith has better stuff than Murphy, but Murphy has much better command and is the perfect sneaky type of pop-starter I expect to surprise non-prospect people when he enters the league.",70,,,30/40,60/65,,,,,,,45/55,,,,65/70,,,Y

The fastball has some natural ride and glove-side run as he almost just slings it from his arm-slot and the sweeper against lefties is funny, because guys think they are about to get nailed and flinch at the pitch that lands in the strike zone. He finished the 2025 season with a 2.75 JA ERA and besides two or three starts was completely dominant the entire season as he increased his pitch count into the 90s to end the year.","Caminiti has shown some impressive stuff and improved as the 2025 season went on, especially the sweeper that is becoming a dominant pitch. The change up has evolved into a splitter with some drop to it that is a nasty change of pace against the fastball and slider. Unlike some of the other young guys, Caminiti's pitch count has been increasing as the season has gone on and he is getting stronger. Caminiti looks like a top of the rotation guy, which bumps him ahead of some higher proximity #3 starter type pitchers like Rhett Lowder and Michael Forret.

He’s a smart pitcher and knows how to mix well, but the question is how much Great American Ballpark will hurt him. He’s been hurt the majority of the year and is slated to get some innings in the Arizona Fall League for a hopefully healthy 2026 season. The change up could be an elite pitch as it has some dive like a sinker.","Lowder has missed the entire season more or less in 2025 and only pitched 9 innings in the Arizona Fall League (though he did have 8 strikeouts and only one walk). He doesn’t really have an elite pitch, which is why I have never been too high on him, but the stuff works well together and he’s a very polished pitcher assuming when he returns to the mound his command is still plus. He should break camp with the team or be up in the rotation early season, but Hagen Smith gets the edge even with the elite command because Lowder likely maxes out as a number 3 starter while Smith has top of rotation upside if he can lock in the command.",77,55/65,,60/65,55/55,55/55,,,50/50,,,,,,,,50/55,,Y
29,88,Michael Forret,SP,Rays,Early 2027,Pablo Lopez / Tanner Bibee mash,"Forret is a nasty kitchen sink, off-tempo athletic righty, rather than a power velocity type. He went to Tread last year and added a couple ticks to his fastball, sitting 94-95 with nice ride on the four seamer, then he throws a sinker with good ride to it to throw hitters off balance. His best secondary is a nasty vertical sweeper, but he also has a gyro slider type spike curve ball / AKA “death ball” that was developed at Tread. He also developed a nasty kick change at Tread (which has more negative vert like a splitter) against his traditional change up. He’s a true pitcher that loves his craft, which is why he’s so good - rather than a thrower pounding velocity.","Forret might be one of the most underrated starters in the minors and a partial explanation is he hasn’t had many ridiculous strikeout games with elite numbers, but is just steadily, consistently good each time out. He also was capped around 75 pitches per game in 2025, which is limiting his innings and inability to pile up strikeouts, but he finished the season with a 2.26 JA ERA and 25.3 K-BB%. The individual pitches may not be elite, but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts with Forret, who will likely start at AA in 2026.

Messick has the kind of stuff that performs better than the pitch metrics itself, because guys just have a tough time squaring him up so even though barrel rates against might not be a consistent stat to predict future performance; he is very good at limiting hard contact and containing damage.",104,65/70,40/45,50/55,50/55,,,,,,,,,,45/50,45/50,,,Y

He’s a shorter, athletically built starter who would be a beast in the bullpen, but has the arsenal to become a starter with a high velo power curve with nice drop as his primary secondary. Wood also throws a tight gyro slider / death ball, but has gone on the record saying he may replace that pitch in his arsenal with something else; which in his first pro start he had added a sinker and standard slider 2-plane slider","There’s some thought Wood could come up in the pen for the Phillies right away based on his limited work . Wood had an injury shortened season after a shoulder issue and had spent previous seasons in the pen. Wood is likely to develop some additional secondaries or work on the new ones around the fastball and curve this offseason, it will be fun to watch, because those two pitches are ridiculous, if he can get a slider or sweeper with horizontal break and pair that with a good splitter or change up, watch out! Wood this high is a major upside play because the most innings he’s pitched in a season through three years of college is 40 ⅓; but there’s a decent amount of hype around him so if you want him you need to go get him.",131,,65/65,50/65,70/70,,,,,,40/45,,,,40/60,N/A(only3thrown),,,Y
32,95,Brody Hopkins,SP,Rays,Late 2026,Shades of a wild Zach Wheeler,"Hopkins has some really great stuff on an individual pitch level, but has had rough control so far this season. He’s almost a side-armer (Funky slightly under ¾ arm-slot) that is tough to pick up and comes in at 96-98 mph with a crazy 88-90 mph slider. He’s a bit of a slinger and on some of the breaking pitches, his arm angle and wrist change to try to get the spin he wants which leads to inconsistencies in the delivery and lack of tunneling. Hopkins is throwing less than 50% strikes per game - he needs to clean up the command to live up to his potential. The curve ball has good depth on it, but it’s rarely in the zone, while the vertical cutter is just a tighter bridge between his sweeper and fastball. The arsenal overall is dirty, I love the sinker and sweeper and he has very good extension.","Hopkins has some command issues and I previously have noted he reminds me of a righty version of Cooper Hjerpe (in my prospect to prospect comp) and has posted a 3.30 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season. He may run into issues in AAA due to the ABS, because his stuff is more likely to generate swings and misses outside of the zone (ala Quinn Mathews) rather than called strikes landing in the zone. Hopkins did finish the season strong with 39 Ks and 15 BBs in his final 6 starts of the season and 2.88 JA ERA and while he has more pitches and some really great stuff, I give Gage Wood the bump for have a couple of elite pitches and better command despite having no track record of being able to rack up innings. There’s a little risk here in the command, but this could be the Nolan McLean of 2026.",103,40/40,50/55,35/40,60/60,,,,,,45/50,60/65,,,,,60/65,,Y
33,98,Quinn Mathews,SP,Cardinals,Early 2026,Cole Ragans light,"Mathews is a big college lefty with some ridiculous breakers that play way better when he can spin his fastball with mid-90s velo and above average rise to it and the slider is a swing and miss machine paired with that fastball. His command has gone from elite to lost this year and he finished much stronger than how he started the year and it’s hard to tell how much of his command issues were due to injury vs. what was due to him having less velocity (lost about 2 mph on his fastball and sinker and 1” of vertical break) and confidence in the fastball, so he wasn’t throwing it in the zone as much as in 2024.","Mathews had a shoulder injury at the beginning of the season that ruined his command and his velocity has been down since last year, but his command has been significantly better since the beginning of August. I have a feeling most of this has to do with hitters sitting on the high fastball letting ABS do the work for them and forcing him to throw the fastball in the zone or fall behind in the count. Mathews needs to spend the offseason working on re-gaining some vertical break and command on the fastball to allow his very good secondaries to play up. Chaim Bloom has had a lot of success when it comes to developing pitchers, so I will give him the benefit of the doubt of correcting Matthews’ down year to see if we get a bounceback to 2024 form. Hopkins gets the edge for having a more widely successful arsenal and it’s pretty clear Mathews’ success will come and go with the fastball, which he needs to at least be a solid 50 for the slider and change up to play off it.",62,70/70,35/45,35/55,40/55,,,,,,,,,,40/50,60/70,,,Y

He has a high run fastball at 18” IVB (and plus ride) that darts in against a fairly nasty 87-89 mph sweeper, a slower loopier 2-plane knuckle-curve and a very solid change up. He has a slight build at 6’2” and only about 180 pounds, but has great locations with only a 5.5% walk rate - he puts the ball where he wants it to go.","The Athletics are being cautious with Lin this year, limiting his pitch count to less than 60 pitches from June, hence the lower innings count, but he was promoted up the levels quickly. Lin had some of the best fScores of any pitcher in the minor leagues in 2025 and has a ton of upside. The pitches all tunnel well against each other and with his superior command, with health he could be a surprise late season or early 2027 debut. We’re missing pitch level data for him and I tend to be skeptical of lower minors stats for pitchers until we see it at AA and AAA, especially considering the ABS and how guys fare when they build up innings.

35,101,Caden Scarborough,SP,Rangers,Mid 2027,Joe Ryan / Shohei Ohtani pitcher mash,Scarborough was absolutely nasty this season and is a big 6’5” power righty with an arsenal highlighted by a potential plus-plus fastball and slider combo where he has a high ride fastball that tops out at 100 against a diving mid 80’s sweeper that sweeps from 1.5 to 7.5 o’clock break and he runs these with a solid change up that he throws mostly against lefties to get them reaching outside of the zone. He seems to have a couple of variations of his slider/sweeper where the spin changes slightly to go from a 1/7 pitch to a 2/8 pitch.,"As much as I wanted to bump Scarborough up into the Top 100 because of how good he was this year, I found it very difficult to bump him any higher than this just because of the proximity factor with so many of these guys a notch above and because I think his fastball might be a tad hitable once he gets up to higher levels and we start getting pitch level data. He may need another variation of fastball to better bridge the fastball and sweeper once he moves up, but he’s undoubtedly been phenomenal and Wei-en Lin barely gets the edge being a lefty, having a better fastball and making it to AA.",N/A,50/55,40/45,55/65,50/60,,,,,,,,,,,,60/70,,Y

He still finished the year with a 2.47 JA ERA and pitches from a very over the top delivery which you don’t see too often, but is becoming more popular between guys like Gibson, Tong and Yesavage. Gibson throws two different fastballs between the four-seamer and the two-seamer (which also sometimes gets labeled as a sinker) and two different sliders (between a sweeper that also gets labeled as a slider, while his gyro slider gets labeled as a cutter).","Gibson is a tunnel master, all of his pitches tunnel together except for the curve ball, but I’m a fan of the fastballs and the two sliders as above average to plus pitches and with better stuff. Gibson profiles as a mid-rotation starter with a kitchen sink approach that results in a groundball guy good at limiting damage. The strikeouts may not be as plentiful in the majors as in the minors, but with command he will still be better than some of their current rotation.

He looks bigger than his 6’ 1” frame with a lanky ¾ trebuchet-like delivery and the fastball has some fantastic movement to it with plus ride from a tough arm angle to pick up for hitters. He focuses on getting ahead in the count early with the fastball and then putting away righties by spotting his slider on the outside corner and puts away lefties with the fastball / changeup combo. The cutter has some nice horizontal run to it and is almost like a sweeper / fastball bridge, rather than having curvy 2 plane break like his slider.","Bratt has been around for a very long time, starting for Team Canada in the World Baseball Classic at age 19 last time around. He has had a 2.59 JA ERA over the last two seasons and a 2.27 JA ERA in 2025 with a ridiculous 25.4 K-BB rate. Interestingly he’s very good friends with Jonah Tong, which means there’s probably a nice level of competition between them. I bumped Bratt ahead of Hess after watching more of his video, while he doesn’t have elite velocity he has some plus movement on the fastball and cutter combination with top of the line command.

The curve is his best breaker as a traditional 12/6 with a lot of arc, while the slider is a vertical gyro slider (which also gets labeled as a cutter) and the change up has some nice movement and could develop into a plus pitch. He can also sometimes get some sinker action on the fastball for some arm-side run.","Hess has worked through some command issues this season, but since the start of July has shown much improved command each start.

Hess has a 2.64 JA ERA (SIERA) this season and has an above average arsenal playing on a plus fastball and got stronger as the season progressed. Hess finished the second half with a 23.1 K-BB% and 2.53 JA ERA all while being promoted to AA.

Hill was extremely impressive and I see a lot of good starters in the Florida State League. Watching him reminded me of Shane McClanahan at first, but the movement on the primary fastball is completely different and upon second consideration his profile is more of the Max Fried type. Hill should scrap throwing the sinker so much and throw the four seamer and curve more. His command has been getting worse as the season has gone on and the Twins are babying him, but he did have a very nice final start of the year.

He still has a lot of work to do in the command department, but he has proximity in his favor and he has enough pitches in his back pocket, including an element of deception in his delivery to allow the stuff to play up better than expected.

He has a lower, ¾ arm-slot that provides for a lot of ride on the fastball, which is his best pitch. There is some relief risk with Fuentes since he’s a primary two pitch guy as he needs to develop at least one more pitch that can go east/west, maybe a sinker - he’s still very young so there is a lot of time to develop without rushing him to the majors again. The curve has two-plane break and nice depth, but needs work on spotting locations.","Fuentes was placed on the IL in early August with shoulder soreness, but he is expected to be at full health in 2026. I’m sure rushing him between all levels of the entire organization was not great for his health last season. Fuentes has a 2.53 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season and a 2.40 through his entire minor league track record, which is insane for a dude who literally made a major league start this year at 19-years-old. He needs to develop a third pitch which pushes him ahead of an older guy behind levels developmentally like Hagaman, but what he’s achieved for his age is exciting.",125,,40/45,45/60,60/70,,,,,,,30/40,,,,,50/60,,Y
45,128,Johnny King,SP,Blue Jays,2028,Shades of Carlos Rodon,"King is an athletically built lefty with a plus high rising fastball from the left side and a plus sinker with some good run to it and he dots it into the zone nicely for strikes. Those two pitches are a fun combo that keep hitters off balance, because they tunnel so well together. The slider isn’t high velo, but it does have a lot of sweeping movement to it across the zone, while the curve almost looks like a slow traditional slider with two-plane break at almost 10 to 4 o’clock with a 18.3 SwStr% at A ball. King has a 2.77 JA ERA (SIERA) on the year.","King is another guy I’ve seen live this year, catching the first low A start of his career. The change up is an underrated pitch with a lot of room to run and at only 19-years-old you know he will be adding velocity as he develops, but he needs to throw it for strikes. He’s polished on the mound, but the breakers need more consistency as the velocity dropped the last few starts of the season as did the strike rate, thus we must assume he needs to build up some durability throughout the year, having only reached 61 ⅔ innings at two levels in 2025. King has a much better arsenal, but Didier Fuentes is only one year older than him and made it to the majors - so this rankings between these two pitchers is all about proximity.",121,35/50,50/55,35/50,55/65,,,,,,,,,,55/60,45/50,,,Y
46,130,Patrick Forbes,SP,Diamondbacks,Mid 2027,Luis Castillo,"Forbes started his college career as shortstop and transitioned over to full-time pitching in 2024 as a reliever, with 2025 being his first season as a starter. He has nasty stuff topping out at 100 mph from a funky, almost side-arm, quick action arm-slot from an athletically built frame. The fastball / slider combo is nasty as the sweeper is a vertically breaking 12/6 sweeper and the fastball, which sits around 94-96 mph, has a decent amount of ride. The change up is also a nice pitch that gets lefties quite often, while the sinker has a good amount of arm-side movement, but lacks command.","Forbes is a bit underrated, because if you look at only the back of the baseball card stats, you might miss out on the upside. The stuff potential is fantastic and it’s easy to forget that Luis Castillo also had some command concerns when he was a prospect and first came up to the majors, but I’ve been around long enough to remember. King has the edge to Forbes with better command and having made his pro debut, but Forbes also has slightly better stuff and could get more strikeouts ultimately.",N/A,45/55,,35/45,60/65,,,,,,35/45,40/55,,,,,55/60,,N
47,131,T.J. Nichols,SP,Rays,Mid/Late 2026,Shades of Logan Gilbert w/ worse stuff,"Nichols was good last year, but has been a completely different pitcher stuff wise in 2025 and is a name everyone should be watching as a former 6th rounder out of Arizona in 2023. He’s a big 6’ 5”, lean righty with a mid 90s fastball and great extension. The command is borderline elite with a really nasty 2-plane 85-88 mph slider. He has top notch command with and has only issued more than 2 walks in a game twice all season and the change up is an oft used, but developing pitch with splitter like tendencies.","Nichols has been throwing 80-100 pitches every time out since the end of May and is built up for a 2026 promotion as he’s pitched to a 2.76 JA ERA (SIERA) on the year. I bumped Nichols ahead of Wenninger even though Wenninger has one elite pitch, because Nichols has a bit better command and has more like a solid #3 upside and is coming off a killer second half where he netted a 25.4 K-BB% and 2.26 JA ERA.",137,40/50,,60/65,55/60,,,,,,,,,,,55/60,,,Y
48,132,Elmer Rodriguez-Cruz,SP,Yankees,Late 2026,Skinny Logan Webb,"Rodriguez-Cruz is a lanky righty who has pushed his way up my list each of the last two updates with big velo gains after moving from the Red Sox to the Yankees. He’s a lot of legs coming at you from a ¾ arm-slot, which may cause some deception. He has five pitches that all play off each other without a traditional fastball, which is strange. The sinker has some ridiculous movement, but I think it would ultimately play better with a four seamer that has some ride to play off of it, rather than just the change up which has the same break as the sinker, except slower. The cutter and curve play off each other as the cutter has a nice 12/6 movement profile, just like the curve - which is kind of vanilla. He also has a gyro slider, which is sometimes now melded with a cutter that has a tight 2-plane break to it and is interesting because most gyro sliders are just a cutter at this point. It has some nice movement, but he can leave it hanging sometimes.","ERC has some interesting stuff, but the lack of a setup - traditional four seamer - is a bit concerning to me. He has posted 2.89 JA ERA (SIERA) on the season and continually improved as the year went on. ERC had a 24.4 K-BB% in the second half and a 2.36 SIERA as he dropped his walk rate from nearly 10% to around 8%. I bumped ERC ahead of Wenninger, like Nichols, when doing the write-ups as his command improved in the back half of the year and we should get some pitch level data next year at AAA to help further evaluate some of the proximity mid-rotation types in this tier.",149,50/55,40/45,45/50,,,,,,,45/50,,,,60/65,45/55,,,Y
49,133,Jack Wenninger,SP,Mets,Mid/Late 2026,Roy Halladay mechanics and build meets Emmet Sheehan light w/ a nasty splitter,"The Wenninger splitter is a monster, this guy is quickly becoming one of my favorite starters in the minors and is on the fast track as a big 6’ 4” dude with wide shoulders and long legs - the classic early 2000s workhorse ace frame. His dominant splitter is complimented by a mid 90s fastball with a hard slider that also gets a lot of swinging strikes. The arsenal is further complimented by a vertical gyro slider that he throws as a spike pitch with nice depth and a progressively better curve that acts as his off-tempo pitch.","Wenninger has a great frame and has an aura of being an old school professional pitcher about him. Wenninger rocked a 3.08 JA ERA (SIERA), but had a rougher second half with only a 11.1 K-BB% and 4.06 SIERA. Wenninger is polished and has a work-horse build. Wenninger has the durability you want to see in a solid mid-rotation piece - I think he’s a lock for a good #3 - #4 starter, but dropped in my rankings with the bad second half because he is a bit too reliant on the elite splitter for success.",107,,40/45,50/55,55/55,,,,,,,65/70,,,45/50,45/20,,,Y
50,134,Kash Mayfield,SP,Padres,Late 2027,Christopher Sanchez with an arm-side fastball,"Mayfield had an excellent season as the big lefty demonstrated improved command from the middle of the season on, including rising pitch counts and a ridiculous 2.37 JA ERA on the year. He’s a big dude throwing from a tricky lower ¾ arm-slot that causes the fastball to have a good amount of natural arm-side run that trips up righties against the 2-plane slider (which is a bit slurvy and I would almost label a sweeper if it had more velocity), while the change up helps him freeze up the lefties as it has a decent amount of vertical drop to it and has some air bender qualities. Mayfield would benefit if he could develop a better bridge pitch on the fastball like a gyro slider.","Mayfield doesn’t have the proximity of the group of guys ranked just ahead of him which pushes him down a bit, while he may have more upside on the pitching stuff alone. He does need to develop at least one more pitch and it will be interesting to see how he adapts to higher pitch counts next season.",N/A,55/70,,40/45,45/55,,,,,,,,,,,50/55,,,Y
51,135,Gage Stanifer,SP,Blue Jays,Mid 2027,,"Stanifer is a pop-up prospect as a later developing 19th rounder who broke out big time in 2025 with a 23.7 K-BB rate and 2.47 JA ERA on the year. Stanifer might have the best sinker in the minor leagues, as it developed from the arsenal grid you see above to a pitch with 17-20” of IVB and another 8” of horizontal movement netting a 17.3 swinging strike rate for the data we have in 2025. The slider is a “death ball” that generated a 91.7% groundball rate in the data sample we have in 2025 and a 17.4% swinging strike rate - the pitch is completely ridiculous. Stanifer has terrible command of his changeup though and is more or less a two pitch guy. He needs to develop at least one additional pitch, ideally two if he can either improve the change-up and then add a sweeper - he could be a monster.","Stanifer has some elite stuff, but also has major reliever risk being a two pitch guy right now with poor command outside of his two primary pitches. He’s incredibly dirty, but he really needs to develop 1-2 pitches to reach his full potential and ideally decrease the walk rate, which will naturally happen with a couple decent other looks he can provide. Stanifer is a fun player to watch.",N/A,20/40,,30/45,,,,,,,,,,,60/70,65/70,,,Y
52,136,Kendry Chourio,SP,Royals,2028,Smaller Jose Fernandez,"Chourio is a 6’0 righty with some ridiculous velocity for his age, there’s some wonderful video of him in A ball with yellow smoke that looks like a Vietnam / Agent Orange situation. He has some decent ride on the fastball, but nothing great and a very nice 2-plane breaking curve against a circle change that he throws inside to righties and down and away to lefties. His biggest asset right now is his ability to locate the fastball, while he has some trouble with control on the curve, the movement is great on it. Chourio only walked 5 batters in 51 ⅓ innings this year, which is completely ridiculous for a 17-year-old.","Chourio has a long way to develop, but the velocity and ability to command his pitches at this age is excellent. Watching him, he reminds me of Jose Fernandez and has the same arsenal to match. He’s finished the year with a 2.85 JA ERA (SIERA) at A ball as a 17-year-old, which is insane. The command is elite, but the stuff must develop for him to have top of the rotation potential - otherwise he’s just a super mature #3 type starter.",135,40/50,55/60,60/70,55/60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y
53,139,George Klassen,SP,Angels,Mid 2026,Jacob DeGrom stuff without the change up & sub-par command,"Klassen was a major pop-up prospect as a 2023 6th rounder who has increased velo after college and then was traded from the Phillies to the Angels in 2024. He was impressive to see live in 2024 with ridiculous stuff, but had obvious command issues. Command improved this year on each of his pitches and he was able to reduce his walk rate from 12% to 9.7% which is definitely viable for him to transition into a major league starter. Klassen has an average build for a starter and throws from a higher ¾ arm-slot. The fastball didn’t play as well in the one AAA start he made in 2025, but he gets both a significant amount of ride and run on the fastballs as they seem to get merged in the pitching models. The four-seamer had closer to 17” of IVB in 2024, but is more like 15-16” in 2025. What gets classified as a curve is more like a sweeper at high 80s velocity and then his cutter and slider are one pitch - a gyro slider.","The stuff is ridiculously good and in the worst case scenario he could be a killer high leverage reliever, because that fastball will always play in both shapes and the power curve / sweeper is absolutely nasty.",141,30/40,,35/45,60/60,,60/65,,,,,,,,,45/55,65/70,,Y
