97,98,Coby Mayo,BAL,1B,1B,13,Big power but no ability to make contact at any level. It seems like an uphill battle for him to stick in an MLB lineup.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/coby-mayo
98,99,Brady House,WSH,3B,3B,9,"A tall 22-year-old with raw power, but the plate discipline means he has an uphill climb to fantasy relevance. Will he even be the Nats starting 3B at beginning of the year?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/brady-house
99,100,Victor Scott II,STL,OF,OF,41,"Can maybe steal 40 bases if he can get on base a bit more, but he's awful in every other category.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180539264/victor-scott-ii
100,101,Casey Schmitt,SF,2B/3B,2B,12,"Hit the ball decently well without any good results last year. Playing time questionable, no speed. But maybe he surprises as a .260 hitter with 16 bombs?",
101,102,Logan O'Hoppe,LAA,C,C,10,"Empty power a 500 PA ceiling. Doesn't hit the ball all that hard. K% has been a major issue two straight years, and now he's 26. Not a fantasy option outside of two catcher leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/logan-ohoppe
102,103,Ryan Jeffers,MIN,C,C,11,"Part time catcher with middling power. He's fine, clearly a big league player, but there's no fantasy upside other than a fine C2 option.",
103,104,Andrew Benintendi,CWS,OF,OF,42,40 homers in the last two seasons with 25+ homer potential. But he does nothing else and I have real doubts about his job security given the age and lack of defense.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/andrew-benintendi
104,105,Edgar Quero,CWS,C,C,12,"Can get some base hits and get on base, but no power or speed and would figure to play behind Kyle Teel",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/edgar-quero
105,106,Sean Murphy,ATL,C,C,13,"If he doesn't DH, he'll be useless. But does still have some power and could perform better if he can find a healthy season.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/sean-murphy
106,107,Nick Gonzales,PIT,2B,2B,13,"The EVs are fine and the sprint speed is really high, but he's never hit many homers or stolen many bases. There's some upside that he can be 10-10 guy with a .270 batting average, but he's nowhere near a standard league consideration. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/nick-gonzales

108,109,Keibert Ruiz,WSH,C,C,14,Concussion issues and has been a very poor hitter in his pretty long career at this point. No reason to consider him in fantasy leagues.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/keibert-ruiz
