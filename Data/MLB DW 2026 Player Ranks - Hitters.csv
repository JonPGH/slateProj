0,1,Ronald Acuna Jr.,ATL,OF,OF,1,"He's been a 24% K% guy every year since 2023. Didn't have the same speed last year. There's a chance he underwhelms in AVG and SB, but he's still an player with as much ceiling as anybody.",
1,2,Gunnar Henderson,BAL,SS,SS,1,"Shook off a slow start nicely. Positive regression coming in LA stuff. Great skills, high floor and high ceiling, and we get a little discount on him after a poor 17-homer season.",
2,3,Nick Kurtz,ATH,1B,1B,1,"50-homer pop, should be a ton of RBI. But with the 30% K%, I'm a bit worried that he could end up with like 36 homers and a .240 batting average.",
3,4,James Wood,WSH,OF,OF,2,"Betting on the skills. Elite raw power and speed. Just lost his way at the plate in the 2H of 2025. Needs to get the K% under 30% and pull a bit more, but the HR/SB is nice and the upside is a round one talent.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/james-wood
4,5,Zach Neto,LAA,SS,SS,2,"He's played at a 25-25 pace in his three years. Good hitter. But limited ceiling due to team context, raw talent, and the strikeout rate. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/zach-neto
5,6,Shea Langeliers,ATH,C,C,1,"Was better than Raleigh (standard roto) in the second half. Dropped the K% eight points, was doing it all in the second half. Great floor driven by the playing time and power, and it looks like he could hit .270 now with the lower K%.",
6,7,Matt Olson,ATL,1B,1B,2,"Routine 30-homer guy with a .240 batting average floor and plenty of RBI. 162 game machine, consistent production.",
7,8,Austin Riley,ATL,3B,3B,1,"Just needs a healthy season to get back to his 35-homer, 90+ RBI ways.",
8,9,C.J. Abrams,WSH,SS,SS,3,"Consistent source of playing time and steals while being fine in average and power. He's a good mid-round pick if you need steals, and I still think his best years are ahead of him. Possible mid-season sell high though? Check the monthly splits.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/cj-abrams
9,10,Byron Buxton,MIN,OF,OF,3,"Top 10 hitter when healthy, but I'm hesitant to pay the rising price for a 32-year-old with this injury sheet. It all depends on what kind of outfielder replacement value your league gives you. ",
10,11,Hunter Goodman,COL,C,C,2,Hit tool seems good enough to keep the power coming. But buying high on a breakout Rockies bat feels more risky than a lot of drafters will think.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/hunter-goodman
11,12,Tyler Soderstrom,ATH,OF/1B,OF,4,"Solid power-hitting floor. K% is good, profiles for a good batting average. Lots to like, and I think there's more power in the tank.",
12,13,Oneil Cruz,PIT,OF,OF,5,"I'm starting to question if he has the ceiling. No improvement in K% or air pull stuff, seems like a 25-homer cap? Solid 25-25 potential, and will bounce back a bit in AVG, but Cruz is mostly a two-category contributor.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/oneil-cruz
13,14,Jordan Westburg,BAL,3B,3B,2,"Good power profile with a nice batting average floor and some upside for 10 steals. He has not stayed healthy, but if he does, he'll be a steal.",
14,15,Michael Harris II,ATL,OF,OF,6,"What a confusing player. Disaster in OBP leagues, but cruises to 15-15 every year. Youth and skill-driven upside, but he's never been consistent.",
15,16,Brent Rooker,ATH,OF,OF,7,"Consistent 30-homer guy at this point, but he's 31 now and the batting average is probably .260-.270. Somewhat replaceable, but good to have OF eligibility. He's fine.",
16,17,Jackson Holliday,BAL,2B,2B,1,"Still super young, key power and K% growth in 2025. Still don't think he's a 30-homer threat, but a 15-25 season seems pretty likely if he can keep developing. And there's plenty of ceiling. I like the floor/ceiling combo feeling I'm getting. ",
17,18,Ezequiel Tovar,COL,SS,SS,4,"improved batted ball profile (LA) between injury stints. solid roto league SS potential, disaster in points / OBP leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/ezequiel-tovar
18,19,Brenton Doyle,COL,OF,OF,8,"Decent buy-low for locked-in playing time with some power and good speed. Subject to huge slumps, very limited counting stat ceiling, but probably an underrated pick in 5 OF leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/brenton-doyle
19,20,Dylan Crews,WSH,OF,OF,9,"Injuries derailed 2025, but he has not hit well in the Majors yet. Nothing terrible under the hood. Betting on the tools here. I like him.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/dylan-crews
20,21,Jo Adell,LAA,OF,OF,10,Good to see the K% get down to 26%. But the steals went away and I'm a little afraid the K% could jump back up. Elite raw power and should have an everyday job while he's still in LA.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jo-adell
21,22,Lawrence Butler,ATH,OF,OF,11,"20-20 player even in a bad year with K% and AVG. Lots of room for growth, and the power/speed gives a nice floor.",
22,23,Mike Trout,LAA,OF,OF,12,"He's mostly an empty power bat this point. K% spiked to 32%, he stopped stealing bases again. There's no longer that top-20 ceiling when he's healthy. But 30-homers and 90 RBI wouldn't shock anybody. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/mike-trout
23,24,Luis Robert,CWS,OF,OF,13,"Serious improvements in plate discipline the last two years, career-low BABIP in 2025. Made himself a positive roto value player with the steals alone. There's still some hope, but the injuries, team context, and recent history make him tough to really buy into",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/luis-robert-jr
24,25,Drake Baldwin,ATL,C,C,3,"Very good hitter, 20+ homer potential with strong ratios. But a 130 GP max? No steals? Will the league adjust?",
25,26,Taylor Ward,BAL,OF,OF,14,"He's getting old! But had a big power season last year and has shown to be a solid hitter for several years now. He could also get traded, and I don't think he has a ton of ceiling, but a solid hitter in multiple ways. ",
26,27,Luke Keaschall,MIN,2B,2B,2,Will get his fantasy value from steals and batting average. So you're relying heavily on another high LD% and BABIP. Power likely to max out at 15 homers? Solid player but can certainly underwhelm for fantasy purposes.,
27,28,Royce Lewis,MIN,3B,3B,3,"Has not been a good hitter in the last two seasons, but maybe it was due to a lack of health? Started stealing bases again in September. Fine source of power, but everything else is in question.",
28,29,Ozzie Albies,ATL,2B,2B,3,I don't see much more upside than a 15-15-.250 season. But that works at the 2B position. And there's some counting stat upside if the Braves have another big year. ,
29,30,Jurickson Profar,ATL,OF,OF,15,"Should play a bunch near the top of the ATL lineup. Has some power and some speed, gets on a base at a good clip. He's fine, but unexciting. ",
30,31,Mickey Moniak,COL,OF,OF,16,"Improved enough in plate discipline to make us think he can stay in the lineup, but the home/road splits and high swing rate will lead to brutal slumps.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/mickey-moniak
31,32,Dylan Beavers,BAL,OF,OF,17,"Five tool potential. Impressive skills. Some questions about playing time, but I like his chances. Could be a very good fantasy player. PT questions after the Ward trade",
32,33,Luis Garcia,WSH,2B,2B,4,"Nearly went 20-20 back in 2024. Elite K% gives him batting average upside, but has never put it all together and will sit a bunch against lefties. Better 5x5 guy than OBP/points.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/luis-garcia-jr
33,34,Jacob Wilson,ATH,SS,SS,5,"Single digit risk in HR and SB, but a shoe in to hit .280+ and he'll play a bunch. ",
34,35,Bryan Reynolds,PIT,OF,OF,18,Good buy-low bounce-back candidate. Was unlucky and still hasn't aged out to the point we should be worried. He's back in the OF3 discussion for next year as a safe-ish player you can get at a big discount.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/bryan-reynolds
35,36,Colson Montgomery,CWS,SS,SS,6,"Clearly has 30-homer potential, but the plate discipline, lack of speed, and team context seem to outweigh the benefits that come from the power. Could see him whiffing his way back to the minors for a stint.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/colson-montgomery
36,37,Spencer Horwitz,PIT,1B,1B,3,"Very solid professional hitter. Gets on base a ton, good bet for a solid AVG and high OBP, but 20 homers feels like a ceiling and he doesn't steal bags. Way better option in points leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/spencer-horwitz
37,38,Colton Cowser,BAL,OF,OF,19,"Big power, decent speed, but lots of strikeouts, some injuries, problems with lefties. Should hang in the lineup with his ability to play CF, but he's a highly volatile player",
38,39,Adley Rutschman,BAL,C,C,4,"How much of 2025 do we forgive because of the oblique injuries? But he also stunk in 2024 with full health. Has never profile for a ton of power or speed. He's suddenly fringey in standard leagues, but we can put the ""buy low"" sticker on him.",
39,40,Samuel Basallo,BAL,C,C,5,"Some risk, high reward. Maybe doesn't play every day, might not be able to hit lefties, could be a very bad AVG. But the upside is very appealing. 40-homer upside.",
40,41,Kyle Teel,CWS,C,C,6,"Enormous potential if he can develop some more power. Batting average looks solid with a great launch angle profile. 15+ homers, 10 steals, .270 average with a bunch of walks.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/kyle-teel
41,42,Jordan Beck,COL,OF,OF,20,"Could be a 20+ homer guy with 15 steals, but the K% and organizational context keep him well outside of standard league consideration. Maybe some upside for deeper leagues, but there are better bets out there.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/jordan-beck
42,43,Daylen Lile,WSH,OF,OF,21,"Put up nice numbers in the 2H with an elite (and yet unrepeatable) launch angle profile. Regression coming on the batting average, and it seems like he over-performed in power. But a good shot to be a .280 hitter with 15-15 upside.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/daylen-lile
43,44,Matt Wallner,MIN,OF,OF,22,"Improved against lefties last year, made more contact, still posted elite HR%. He is a valuable per-game fantasy player and gets boosted in OBP/points leagues. But a fringey top 300 player in my estimation.",
44,45,Lenyn Sosa,CWS,2B/1B,2B,5,"Power surge in late 2025, but didn't show that prior. Solid hit tool, can be a batting average guy. But if the power regresses back (likely), he's not worth much in a fantasy league.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/lenyn-sosa
45,46,Miguel Vargas,CWS,3B/1B,3B,4,"He is a league-average hitter who excels at nothing. Not a horrible depth option for volume purposes, but no real fantasy appeal at the end of the day. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/miguel-vargas
46,47,Jared Triolo,PIT,SS/3B/1B,SS,7,"The triple eligibility is nice and he ended the year very nicely with the bat. That was very uncommon for him, his career offensive numbers are bad. But he makes contact, steals some bags, and plays all over the infield. Decent depth option in super deep leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/jared-triolo
47,48,Tyler O'Neill,BAL,OF,OF,23,"He can still hit the longball, but the batting average is usually pretty bad, the K% is high, and he doesn't do much base stealing anymore. At 31 with the injury history, he's hard to like.",
48,49,Nolan Schanuel,LAA,1B,1B,4,"Reliable playing time and OBP. Hits high in the order. But outside of points leagues, he's not a positive fantasy player. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/nolan-schanuel
49,50,Christian Moore,LAA,2B,2B,6,"Power and speed skills are there, but the contact rates were awful and he didn't pull many fly balls. I like to bet on skills in the second-year player, but he has a long way to go.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/christian-moore
50,51,Coby Mayo,BAL,1B,1B,5,Big power but no ability to make contact at any level. It seems like an uphill battle for him to stick in an MLB lineup.,
51,52,Zac Veen,COL,OF,OF,24,"Potential to be an elite source of steals. Maybe a 15-homer bat? But it's a longshot. Viewing him as ""wait and see steals streamer"" ahead of 2026 drafts for now.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/zac-veen
52,53,Brooks Lee,MIN,SS/3B/2B,SS,8,"His 16 homers last year make no sense to me. He doesn't steal bases, his xBA was bad... there's nothing to like offensively.",
53,54,Zack Gelof,ATH,2B,2B,7,"Power and speed, sure, but a 65% Z-Contact% last year! Has a long way to go, but if he can manage a 27% K% again, he'll have a decent roto year. I think he starts back in AAA. Floor is zero.",
54,55,Chase Meidroth,CWS,SS/2B,SS,9,"No power, very replaceable speed, does not swing the bat. Nothing to like.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/chase-meidroth
55,56,Brady House,WSH,3B,3B,5,"A tall 22-year-old with raw power, but the plate discipline means he has an uphill climb to fantasy relevance. Will he even be the Nats starting 3B at beginning of the year?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/brady-house
56,57,Logan O'Hoppe,LAA,C,C,7,"Empty power a 500 PA ceiling. Doesn't hit the ball all that hard. K% has been a major issue two straight years, and now he's 26. Not a fantasy option outside of two catcher leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/logan-ohoppe
57,58,Ryan Jeffers,MIN,C,C,8,"Part time catcher with middling power. He's fine, clearly a big league player, but there's no fantasy upside other than a fine C2 option.",
58,59,Jorge Soler,LAA,OF,OF,25,It looks like it's over for Soler. High K% and the raw power is drying up. ,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jorge-soler
59,60,Andrew Benintendi,CWS,OF,OF,26,40 homers in the last two seasons with 25+ homer potential. But he does nothing else and I have real doubts about his job security given the age and lack of defense.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/andrew-benintendi

61,62,Sean Murphy,ATL,C,C,10,"If he doesn't DH, he'll be useless. But does still have some power and could perform better if he can find a healthy season.",
62,63,Nick Gonzales,PIT,2B,2B,8,"The EVs are fine and the sprint speed is really high, but he's never hit many homers or stolen many bases.

63,64,Keibert Ruiz,WSH,C,C,11,Concussion issues and has been a very poor hitter in his pretty long career at this point. No reason to consider him in fantasy leagues.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/keibert-ruiz
