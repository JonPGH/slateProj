0,1,Corbin Carroll,ARI,OF,OF,1,"Added a ton of power in 2025 without losing much in SB. Probably not the 50 SB threat we saw early on, but a 25-homer, 35-steal guy easily with a bunch of counting stats (it would certainly help if the DBacks retain Ketel Marte)",
1,2,Ronald Acuna Jr.,ATL,OF,OF,2,"He's been a 24% K% guy every year since 2023. Didn't have the same speed last year. There's a chance he underwhelms in AVG and SB, but he's still an player with as much ceiling as anybody.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/ronald-acuna-jr
2,3,Gunnar Henderson,BAL,SS,SS,1,"Shook off a slow start nicely. Positive regression coming in LA stuff. Great skills, high floor and high ceiling, and we get a little discount on him after a poor 17-homer season.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/gunnar-henderson
3,4,Junior Caminero,TB,3B,3B,1,"50-homers, .300 batting average upside. Will need to slightly improve in hit tool to get there, and the park shift sucks for him, but it seems like a 35-homer, 100-RBI, .260 batting average floor on top of one of the highest ceilings in the game. ",
4,5,Nick Kurtz,ATH,1B,1B,1,"50-homer pop, should be a ton of RBI. But with the 30% K%, I'm a bit worried that he could end up with like 36 homers and a .240 batting average.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/nick-kurtz

26,27,Jo Adell,LAA,OF,OF,11,Good to see the K% get down to 26%. But the steals went away and I'm a little afraid the K% could jump back up. Elite raw power and should have an everyday job while he's still in LA.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jo-adell

33,34,Luke Keaschall,MIN,2B,2B,4,Will get his fantasy value from steals and batting average. So you're relying heavily on another high LD% and BABIP. Power likely to max out at 15 homers? Solid player but can certainly underwhelm for fantasy purposes.,
