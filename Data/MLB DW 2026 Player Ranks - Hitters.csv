1,2,Corbin Carroll,ARI,OF,OF,1,"Added a ton of power in 2025 without losing much in SB. Probably not the 50 SB threat we saw early on, but a 25-homer, 35-steal guy easily with a bunch of counting stats (it would certainly help if the DBacks retain Ketel Marte)",
2,3,Ronald Acuna Jr.,ATL,OF,OF,2,"He's been a 24% K% guy every year since 2023. Didn't have the same speed last year. There's a chance he underwhelms in AVG and SB, but he's still an player with as much ceiling as anybody.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/ronald-acuna-jr

4,5,Gunnar Henderson,BAL,SS,SS,3,"Shook off a slow start nicely. Positive regression coming in LA stuff. Great skills, high floor and high ceiling, and we get a little discount on him after a poor 17-homer season.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/gunnar-henderson
5,6,Junior Caminero,TB,3B,3B,1,"50-homers, .300 batting average upside.

26,27,Geraldo Perdomo,ARI,SS,SS,7,"He's likely to regress at least a handful of homers, and possibly a few steals. The lineup around him might be mediocre. I think he'll be way over-priced in 2026",
