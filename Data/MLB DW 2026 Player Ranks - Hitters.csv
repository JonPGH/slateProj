2,3,Corbin Carroll,ARI,OF,OF,2,"Added a ton of power in 2025 without losing much in SB.

3,4,Ronald Acuna Jr.,ATL,OF,OF,3,"He's been a 24% K% guy every year since 2023. Didn't have the same speed last year. There's a chance he underwhelms in AVG and SB, but he's still an player with as much ceiling as anybody.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/ronald-acuna-jr

6,7,Junior Caminero,TB,3B,3B,1,"50-homers, .300 batting average upside.

17,18,Byron Buxton,MIN,OF,OF,6,"Top 10 hitter when healthy, but I'm hesitant to pay the rising price for a 32-year-old with this injury sheet. It all depends on what kind of outfielder replacement value your league gives you. ",
