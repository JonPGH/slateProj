0,1,Ronald Acuna Jr.,ATL,OF,OF,1,"He's been a 24% K% guy every year since 2023. Didn't have the same speed last year. There's a chance he underwhelms in AVG and SB, but he's still an player with as much ceiling as anybody.",
1,2,Gunnar Henderson,BAL,SS,SS,1,"Shook off a slow start nicely. Positive regression coming in LA stuff. Great skills, high floor and high ceiling, and we get a little discount on him after a poor 17-homer season.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/gunnar-henderson
2,3,Junior Caminero,TB,3B,3B,1,"50-homers, .300 batting average upside. Will need to slightly improve in hit tool to get there, and the park shift sucks for him, but it seems like a 35-homer, 100-RBI, .260 batting average floor on top of one of the highest ceilings in the game. ",
3,4,Nick Kurtz,ATH,1B,1B,1,"50-homer pop, should be a ton of RBI. But with the 30% K%, I'm a bit worried that he could end up with like 36 homers and a .240 batting average.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/nick-kurtz
4,5,James Wood,WSH,OF,OF,2,"Betting on the skills. Elite raw power and speed. Just lost his way at the plate in the 2H of 2025. Needs to get the K% under 30% and pull a bit more, but the HR/SB is nice and the upside is a round one talent.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/james-wood
5,6,Zach Neto,LAA,SS,SS,2,"He's played at a 25-25 pace in his three years. Good hitter. But limited ceiling due to team context, raw talent, and the strikeout rate. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/zach-neto
6,7,Shea Langeliers,ATH,C,C,1,"Was better than Raleigh (standard roto) in the second half. Dropped the K% eight points, was doing it all in the second half. Great floor driven by the playing time and power, and it looks like he could hit .270 now with the lower K%.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/shea-langeliers

9,10,C.J. Abrams,WSH,SS,SS,3,"Consistent source of playing time and steals while being fine in average and power. He's a good mid-round pick if you need steals, and I still think his best years are ahead of him. Possible mid-season sell high though? Check the monthly splits.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/cj-abrams
10,11,Byron Buxton,MIN,OF,OF,3,"Top 10 hitter when healthy, but I'm hesitant to pay the rising price for a 32-year-old with this injury sheet. It all depends on what kind of outfielder replacement value your league gives you. ",
11,12,Hunter Goodman,COL,C,C,2,Hit tool seems good enough to keep the power coming. But buying high on a breakout Rockies bat feels more risky than a lot of drafters will think.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/hunter-goodman
12,13,Tyler Soderstrom,ATH,OF/1B,OF,4,"Solid power-hitting floor. K% is good, profiles for a good batting average. Lots to like, and I think there's more power in the tank.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/tyler-soderstrom
13,14,Oneil Cruz,PIT,OF,OF,5,"I'm starting to question if he has the ceiling. No improvement in K% or air pull stuff, seems like a 25-homer cap? Solid 25-25 potential, and will bounce back a bit in AVG, but Cruz is mostly a two-category contributor.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/oneil-cruz
14,15,Jordan Westburg,BAL,3B,3B,3,"Good power profile with a nice batting average floor and some upside for 10 steals. He has not stayed healthy, but if he does, he'll be a steal.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/jordan-westburg
15,16,Michael Harris II,ATL,OF,OF,6,"What a confusing player. Disaster in OBP leagues, but cruises to 15-15 every year. Youth and skill-driven upside, but he's never been consistent.",
16,17,Brent Rooker,ATH,OF,OF,7,"Consistent 30-homer guy at this point, but he's 31 now and the batting average is probably .260-.270. Somewhat replaceable, but good to have OF eligibility. He's fine.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/brent-rooker
17,18,Jackson Holliday,BAL,2B,2B,1,"Still super young, key power and K% growth in 2025. Still don't think he's a 30-homer threat, but a 15-25 season seems pretty likely if he can keep developing. And there's plenty of ceiling. I like the floor/ceiling combo feeling I'm getting. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/jackson-holliday
18,19,Ezequiel Tovar,COL,SS,SS,4,"improved batted ball profile (LA) between injury stints. solid roto league SS potential, disaster in points / OBP leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/ezequiel-tovar
19,20,Brenton Doyle,COL,OF,OF,8,"Decent buy-low for locked-in playing time with some power and good speed. Subject to huge slumps, very limited counting stat ceiling, but probably an underrated pick in 5 OF leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/brenton-doyle
20,21,Dylan Crews,WSH,OF,OF,9,"Injuries derailed 2025, but he has not hit well in the Majors yet. Nothing terrible under the hood. Betting on the tools here. I like him.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/dylan-crews
21,22,Jo Adell,LAA,OF,OF,10,Good to see the K% get down to 26%. But the steals went away and I'm a little afraid the K% could jump back up. Elite raw power and should have an everyday job while he's still in LA.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jo-adell
22,23,Lawrence Butler,ATH,OF,OF,11,"20-20 player even in a bad year with K% and AVG. Lots of room for growth, and the power/speed gives a nice floor.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/lawrence-butler
23,24,Mike Trout,LAA,OF,OF,12,"He's mostly an empty power bat this point. K% spiked to 32%, he stopped stealing bases again. There's no longer that top-20 ceiling when he's healthy. But 30-homers and 90 RBI wouldn't shock anybody. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/mike-trout
24,25,Luis Robert,CWS,OF,OF,13,"Serious improvements in plate discipline the last two years, career-low BABIP in 2025. Made himself a positive roto value player with the steals alone.

25,26,Drake Baldwin,ATL,C,C,3,"Very good hitter, 20+ homer potential with strong ratios. But a 130 GP max? No steals? Will the league adjust?",
26,27,Taylor Ward,BAL,OF,OF,14,"He's getting old! But had a big power season last year and has shown to be a solid hitter for several years now. He could also get traded, and I don't think he has a ton of ceiling, but a solid hitter in multiple ways. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/taylor-ward
27,28,Luke Keaschall,MIN,2B,2B,2,Will get his fantasy value from steals and batting average. So you're relying heavily on another high LD% and BABIP. Power likely to max out at 15 homers? Solid player but can certainly underwhelm for fantasy purposes.,
28,29,Royce Lewis,MIN,3B,3B,4,"Has not been a good hitter in the last two seasons, but maybe it was due to a lack of health? Started stealing bases again in September. Fine source of power, but everything else is in question.",
29,30,Ozzie Albies,ATL,2B,2B,3,I don't see much more upside than a 15-15-.250 season. But that works at the 2B position. And there's some counting stat upside if the Braves have another big year. ,
30,31,Chandler Simpson,TB,OF,OF,15,"Can steal 70 bags and hit .280. But zero homers and questions about the playing time because of the shaky defense. Tough call to make, but he fits a certain draft strategy.",
31,32,Jurickson Profar,ATL,OF,OF,16,"Should play a bunch near the top of the ATL lineup. Has some power and some speed, gets on a base at a good clip. He's fine, but unexciting. ",
32,33,Ivan Herrera,STL,C,C,4,"Solid bat, high floor. 20-homers, 10-steal potential. But not the biggest ceiling, and there were a lot of injuries last year. ",

34,35,Yandy Diaz,TB,1B,1B,3,"The park change is going to hurt, and he's at the age where you really start worry. A Diaz fade is a pretty safe thing to do in my mind. He's not going to be a huge positive in anything but points leagues. ",
35,36,Bryan Reynolds,PIT,OF,OF,17,Good buy-low bounce-back candidate. Was unlucky and still hasn't aged out to the point we should be worried. He's back in the OF3 discussion for next year as a safe-ish player you can get at a big discount.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/bryan-reynolds
36,37,Colson Montgomery,CWS,SS,SS,6,"Clearly has 30-homer potential, but the plate discipline, lack of speed, and team context seem to outweigh the benefits that come from the power.

37,38,Brandon Lowe,TB,2B,2B,4,"Well over 30 now, injury questions, platoon questions, park downgrade (trade?), not much other than the power. But the power is good!",
38,39,Jonathan Aranda,TB,1B,1B,4,"Higher K% and Cont% than you're comfortable with, and huge BABIP regression is due. Also he's likely in a partial platoon. But he's a good bet for batting average and some RBI with 20+ HR potential.",
39,40,Luis Garcia,WSH,2B,2B,5,"Nearly went 20-20 back in 2024. Elite K% gives him batting average upside, but has never put it all together and will sit a bunch against lefties. Better 5x5 guy than OBP/points.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/luis-garcia-jr
40,41,Dylan Beavers,BAL,OF,OF,18,"Five tool potential. Impressive skills. Some questions about playing time, but I like his chances. Could be a very good fantasy player. PT questions after the Ward trade",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/dylan-beavers
41,42,Willson Contreras,STL,1B,1B,5,"Guy still has 25+ homer pop and should hit in the middle of the lineup. But injuries, age, and no more catcher eligibility. The downside seems very big. ",
42,43,Colton Cowser,BAL,OF,OF,19,"Big power, decent speed, but lots of strikeouts, some injuries, problems with lefties. Should hang in the lineup with his ability to play CF, but he's a highly volatile player",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/colton-cowser
43,44,Adley Rutschman,BAL,C,C,5,"How much of 2025 do we forgive because of the oblique injuries? But he also stunk in 2024 with full health. Has never profile for a ton of power or speed.

44,45,Samuel Basallo,BAL,C,C,6,"Some risk, high reward. Maybe doesn't play every day, might not be able to hit lefties, could be a very bad AVG. But the upside is very appealing. 40-homer upside.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/samuel-basallo
45,46,Kyle Teel,CWS,C,C,7,"Enormous potential if he can develop some more power. Batting average looks solid with a great launch angle profile. 15+ homers, 10 steals, .270 average with a bunch of walks.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/kyle-teel
46,47,Alec Burleson,STL,1B/OF,1B,6,"Good batting average, 20-homer pop, handful of steals. He's just ""fine"" across the board.",
47,48,Spencer Horwitz,PIT,1B,1B,7,"Very solid professional hitter. Gets on base a ton, good bet for a solid AVG and high OBP, but 20 homers feels like a ceiling and he doesn't steal bags. Way better option in points leagues.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/spencer-horwitz
48,49,Mickey Moniak,COL,OF,OF,20,"Improved enough in plate discipline to make us think he can stay in the lineup, but the home/road splits and high swing rate will lead to brutal slumps.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/mickey-moniak
49,50,Jordan Beck,COL,OF,OF,21,"Could be a 20+ homer guy with 15 steals, but the K% and organizational context keep him well outside of standard league consideration. Maybe some upside for deeper leagues, but there are better bets out there.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/jordan-beck
50,51,Daylen Lile,WSH,OF,OF,22,"Put up nice numbers in the 2H with an elite (and yet unrepeatable) launch angle profile.

51,52,Matt Wallner,MIN,OF,OF,23,"Improved against lefties last year, made more contact, still posted elite HR%. He is a valuable per-game fantasy player and gets boosted in OBP/points leagues. But a fringey top 300 player in my estimation.",
52,53,Brendan Donovan,STL,2B,2B,6,"I don't think he can get to 20 homers or even 10 steals. A trade might make him interesting, but the fantasy value just isn't there for standard leagues where you have replacement value.",
53,54,JJ Wetherholt,STL,SS,SS,7,"Great hit tool and disciplne, but I'm not sure we have 20 HR or 20 SB potential out of the gate. Also, we need to find out if he'll make the team out of camp. ",
54,55,Lenyn Sosa,CWS,2B/1B,2B,7,"Power surge in late 2025, but didn't show that prior. Solid hit tool, can be a batting average guy. But if the power regresses back (likely), he's not worth much in a fantasy league.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/lenyn-sosa
