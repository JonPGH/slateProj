0,1,Konnor Griffin,SS/OF,Pirates,Late 2026,Light Fernando Tatis Jr. with an Elly de la Cruz statistical profile,"Griffin is a big righty with a good arm as a high school pitcher and he has some massive power upside.  The high stance and high and tight hands in his swing reminds me of Fernando Tatis Jr. and like Tatis, he will probably have plenty of swing and miss to go with the damage. Tools for days here as Griffin has already posted a max EV of 114.2 and has a 90th percentile EV of nearly 108.  The hit tool is better than expected, but still might only tune in at slightly above league average as he could do better on the angles ala Elly de la Cruz coming up (52% groundball rate and only 7 degree average launch angle).","Griffin has the highest upside of any prospect in baseball and has shown this season to have a much safer hit tool than previously expected after some changes to his batting stance.  He could maximize his skillset further by becoming more efficient on the basepaths and improving his bat path for better angles to generate a higher level of quality contact.  Griffin seemingly improved upon being promoted from low A to AA throughout the course of the season and while some think he will break camp, I doubt the Pirates will allow him to skip AAA and think the absolute best case scenario for promotion would be June or July sans a team friendly long-term contract.",1,50/55,45/55,60/70,70/70,
1,2,Kevin McGonigle,2B / SS,Tigers,Early 2026,"Chase Utley wannabe, but the profile might be more like Nomar Garciaparra","This kid has an insane hit tool and plate skills with developing power.  Despite lackluster angles in our limited statcast data available with only a 6.3% barrel rate and a 103.6 90th percentile, he has recorded much higher max EVs to last year constantly touching 111 and reportedly hitting 112 mph.  He’s a doubles machine with 31 doubles in only 88 games this year.","It’s hard to show concern for a guy with such a honed hit tool and a nicely developing power stroke, however the speed has taken a dump this year as he went from 22 steals and only 2 caught stealing last year to only 10 steals and 7 times caught stealing this year.  There are also some injury concerns I have that nobody wants to discuss, but he only played in 74 games last year after breaking a hamate bone and this year has only played in 88 games after starting the year late from a high ankle sprain.  Griffin has a higher power/speed upsides, but in a points league, I’m probably picking McGonigle first overall.",4,60/70,70/70,55/60,45/50,
2,4,Samuel Basallo,C / 1B,Orioles,Debuted,Kyle Schwarber with a better hit tool,"Solid plate discipline and crazy power for his age, Bassallo has improved as the season has gone on in regards to quality of contact and angles.  The dude is built for his age with fast hands, but a tight / weird batting stance.  He will likely move off the catcher position full-time because of Rutschman.  The contact rates are slightly below average (but we should also be considering his age), but the quality of contact numbers are ridiculous as he’s rocking a 21.5 barrel% and 15 average LA on the season with more line drives and flyballs coming as the season has gone on.","Basallo has massive power potential as he is currently rocking a 108.3 90th percentile EV, 115.9 max EV and 94.2 average EV as a 20-year-old the majority of the season at AAA.  He doesn’t have wheels and luckily it sounds like the Orioles have a plan for playing time as a backup C and DH so I wouldn’t worry too much about playing time.  He may have the highest age adjusted wRC+ due to his performance way above expected at AAA and the MLB.  He is a max four category guy, so that will always limit his fantasy ceiling outside of points leagues.",3,50/60,50/60,65/70,35/40,
3,5,JJ Wetherholt,2B/SS/3B,Cardinals,Early 2026,Corbin Carroll / Marcus Semien mash-up,"Wetherholt hits the crap out of the ball for a smaller guy, is athletic and has a great eye at the plate.  He has quick, an easy swing and great bat control that will likely lead to an early career high doubles profile that later translates into more power as he gets closer to his peak.  Wetherholt has an average EV of 91.4 this season at AAA with a 109.2 max EV to go along with an aggressive in zone approach with a high propensity for quality contact with an 11.9 barrel% and great angles with an aptitude to hit to all fields with a near 25% linedrive rate.","Wetherholt is probably the most well-rounded prospect in this rankings update and should have a number of .280/.370/.480 seasons in the majors with 20/20 outcomes from what will likely either be second or third base.  In AAA he played 12 games at third, 24 games at SS and only 3 games at second base.  It will be interesting to see where the Cardinals fit him in around Masyn Winn, the assumption is he plays primarily second base, but I think he has the defensive chops to play third base.  Wetherholt has a very high floor and while there are prospects lower in the rankings with a higher ceiling, Wetherholt appears to be a lock as an All Star caliber player and while he doesn’t have an elite tool like Basallo’s power, his super power is consistency in all assets of the game.",6,60/65,65/70,50/55,55/60,
4,6,Max Clark,OF,Tigers,Late 2026,Corbin Carroll,"Multi-sport athlete; has a really nice hit tool, a lot of speed and should develop more power as he ages.  He’s likely to develop more into a speed first, 15-20 homer type based on the small sample size of what we have seen in the minors and pre-draft, though there is room for growth as his low A max EV last year was 106.7 and he’s recorded up to a 111.2 max EV this year in limited data samples.  While the hit tool is already 70 grade from a contact standpoint, it’s subpar in regards to squaring up despite a much improved batted ball profile and angles since getting to AA.  My biggest worry is the power tool at this point, especially from a split standpoint where all ten of his homers have come against righties this season, while last year he actually hit lefties better than righties, but he is working hard this offseason to hone his power swing. With his speed, he should be more aggressive on the basepaths.","Clark was drafted primarily for the potential of his tools, but his hit tool and plate skills are the most impressive pieces of his profile right now.  He looks like he could be one of the better players in baseball when he makes it to the big leagues - I would like to see him swing more aggressively in the zone, but funny enough the profile almost resembles Riley Greene with slightly less power, but a lot more speed, though he needs to be more aggressive on the basepaths.  If Clark can run more and better utilize his speed, he could regain top prospect status prior to graduation.",2,60/70,60/70,45/60,55/70,
5,7,Jesus Made,SS,Brewers,Late 2027,Smaller switch-hitting infield Christian Yelich profile and swing mechanics,"We don’t have a lot of statcast data on Made yet, but we have a recorded max EV of 111 at high A and a reported 90th percentile EV of 103.9 with an advanced hit tool on both sides of the plate.  Made is a true switch hitter with no split concerns though the slash as a righty is a bit better despite a higher K rate against lefties.  Made is aggressive on the basepaths, but needs to clean up the steals game a bit having been caught stealing 13 times this year.","Made’s plate skills and athleticism have been impressive this season and though he has a leaner, but more twitchy type athleticism to him.  He’s playing way above age-to-level just like Clark and others like De Vries and Walcott, but has tended to a stronger all around profile with a higher floor and just as high of a ceiling.  Most will have Made ahead of Clark and I get it, but Clark is such a beast when it comes to work ethic and I believe the speed for him is all about when he starts aggressively running, not if - still love made obviously as he is a potential future #1 prospect.",8,55/65,55/60,50/60,60/65,
6,9,Edward Florentino,OF,Pirates,2028,Lefty Julio Rodriguez with potentially a better hit tool,"Florentino is a big, twitchy lefty with a large stride in his swing and is definitely the largest riser from the last ranking to this one after demonstrating a smooth transition to A ball with a plus to potentially plus, plus hit tool thanks to maybe the best angles in baseball.  The power is fantastic and Florentino is the master of fScores with the highest grade of anyone in the minors.","The hit tool is only dampered by the fact he could afford to be more aggressive in-zone to avoid Emmanuel Rodriguez syndrome as he climbs the ranks and he does have some trouble against lefties, at least a low A.  Florentino has the highest upside to anyone not named Griffin or McGonigle, but we have to keep the fact he’s only played up to low A in tow in order to reign in an accurate ranking.  Further proximity also affects this ranking, but he’s still top 10 and may be a future #1 at some point after some guys in front of him graduate.",12,60/70,55/60,50/65,60/60,
7,10,Walker Jenkins,OF,Twins,Mid 2026,Larry Walker / OF Freddie Freeman,"Big, strong lefty for his age and one of the top five guys from the 2023 draft class. He has a ton of pull power, but can hit for extra base hits through all fields.  Jenkins’ carrying tool thus far has been the combo of his plus hit tool, alongside an above average plate approach, but he has not yet developed the power his big frame should get into and he needs to work on his angles - though the angles and power did improve significantly toward the tail end of the season when he got healthy.","It should be noted despite too many injuries, Jenkins has still managed to climb to AAA at the age of 20 and have strong numbers.  If he had consistent health he would be seen as a consensus top 10 prospect, but I suspect others will weigh the lack of plate appearances and the back of baseball card stats against him - providing some nice value in dynasty leagues.  Jenkins profiles more as a points league darling due to an average to above average expected output in the steals department.",7,60/70,55/65,50/60,55/50,
8,11,Luis Pena,SS/3B,Brewers,Mid 2027,Righty only Francisco Lindor mechanics meets a light Jose Ramirez skillset,"Pena is a shorter build for a 3B ala Jose Ramirez and has a good hit tool with an 78.5% contact rate that has taken a beating at high A.  While you might think I’m crazy to compare Pena to Jose Ramirez, J Ram was basically a non-prospect seen as just a slightly solid player around the board.  Pena has a drastic edge on him from prospecting standards.","Pena has struggled a bit in his high A small sample size by being too patient, which has resulted in both a lower contact rate and high K rate at the level with only a 37.6% swing rate.  If Pena were more aggressive at the plate he would run into better counting stats, but for now as he transitions up levels, though the upside is there we must be a tad hesitant to bump him ahead of higher proximity guys.  Jenkins gets an edge to Pena with a higher floor, while they have similar ceilings.",15,55/65,50/55,50/60,60/65,
9,12,Aidan Miller,SS,Phillies,Mid 2026,Royce Lewis w/ More Athleticism and Health,"This dude is an athlete, I had a live look on him and he’s really just a super athlete and a gamer.  A lot of people thought he would move off SS to 3B, but he looks super smooth and athletic and he should stay at SS as long as he can.  He has above average to plus tools across the board with an improved hit tool this year and a great ability to pull the ball in the air plus quality attack angles, but Miller is still pretty raw and seems to run into issues when he gets to a new level, then adapts. He’s young for the level at AAA and with improved athleticism he may be able to stick at SS if the Phillies wanted to move Trea to 2B as he ages, but Miller will likely land at 3B.","Miller’s improved hit and speed in 2025 have changed his career arc from being a potential Matt Shaw type to being a level above, he has All Star potential if not greater if he continues to progress at the current rate.  Pena has more of a track record in the hit and speed departments and while Miller should get to more power, he has had less consistency in his MILB career, though it’s close because he also has much closer proximity to the majors than Pena.  Pena gets a slight edge due to a safer floor.",38,55/60,55/60,55/60,65/60,
10,13,Sebastian Walcott,SS,Rangers,Early 2027,"Fernando Tatis Jr. - light, similar build and swing","Super raw, a huge 19-year-old kid with raw power for days (115.1 EV posted this spring).  He needs to further develop the hit tool and plate skills, but the tools are there and he debuted at high A as a 17-year-old.  He ran an improved hit tool in the second half and hit .323 with an 82% contact rate in the final month of the season, but the power was lacking.  Ultimately the raw power and power ceiling are extremely high and he will get to the homers, the concern is if there will be a trade-off in the hit tool to get there.  He also walked more than he struck out over this period.","The kid is still super raw and we are seeing the talent develop starting mid-season from a set of tools into a baseball player.  Walcott is in this middle zone at this point where he has been pushed very hard, very fast by the Rangers as he’s a 3-4 years younger than the average player in AA hence the age adjusted wRC+ of 187 which is higher than anyone else we have looked at in the top of the rankings outside of Samuel Basallo who is now in the majors.  Some patience is needed here with Walcott.",10,45/50,50/60,45/65,55/50,
11,14,Leo De Vries,SS,Athletics,Mid 2027,Switch hitting Alfonso Soriano at SS,"De Vries has super high upside across the board and is a potential five-tool switch hitting talent who has continually played at a high age-to-level.  De Vries is absolutely electric and has a long swing despite quick hands, giving me that Soriano feeling. His contact rates improved after some transition with the Athletics and he gets to good angles. De Vries became more aggressive at the plate with the Athletics with an increased swing rate which will help his hit tool trend to plus considering his age to the level he’s at and he has a max EV at 110, however the 90th percentile is only at 102.1 mph and he has been caught stealing 8 times this year.  I do have some splits concerns as he absolutely destroyed righties from the left side, but struggled against lefties from the other side of the plate.","De Vries is a year behind Walcott, but since the two have traversed up the prospect rankings list together as a sort of athletic SS tandem way above age to level it’s hard not to compare them.  Ultimately De Vries has better foundational mechanics and appears to have better bat speed, while Walcott is bigger and has a higher power ceiling with more raw athleticism and that’s what gives him the edge when I compare the two.",14,50/60,55/55,50/60,40/50,
12,16,Dylan Beavers,OF,Orioles,Debuted,Kyle Tucker mechanics with a Jarren Duran skillset,Big lefty outfielder who killed it in the doubles department last year and is not transitioning some of that into homerun power in 2025.  There’s a potential 20/25 player here if he can hit enough to make it work as the 105.4 90th percentile EV and 111.6 max EV portend to at least 20 homer power. The hit tool has progressed dramatically since last season as he now has a well above average 89.5 Z-Contact% and 82.6 Contact% with only a 19.4% chase rate with excellent angles as he has rocked an average 17 degree launch angle this year and solid 9.3% barrel rate; he has a good bat for line drives.,"Beavers had a very strong 2024 and has only gotten better in 2025.  I’ve been one of the higher guys on Beavers the last year or two and I expect him to finish higher on my list than others, as I think his hit tool could be greater than plus and the transition to the majors may depend on a his above average plate approach tracking to plus to see if he can avoid falling into inconsistencies.  Beavers has a very high floor thanks to the evolution of his hit tool and while some younger shortstops like De Vries and Walcott have higher ceilings for power the proximity bump and sure hit tool of Beavers draws him a little closer to that higher tier of guys in my ranking than in most.",21,60/65,60/60,55/55,60/55,
13,17,Eduardo Quintero,OF,Dodgers,Late 2027,Shades of Wander Franco as an OF with less power and more speed,"Fantastic plate skills (only a 19.4 chase rate in 2024) and a heck of an athlete;  Quintero has a solid hit tool with a knack for barreling the ball and brings a ton of athleticism to the plate.  He’s taken it to another level this season from a power and speed angle, performing at a now elite level, I just wish I had statcast data on him as the best I have is a reported 106.6 90th percentile EV in 2024, which is killer for last season at 18-years-old.","The hit tool has room to improve if he can be a little more aggressive in zone to generate more contact.  Quintero has top 5, or higher, prospect upside depending on who comes and who goes within the next year or so, as he will probably move up the rankings as long as the production and improvements in the underlying metrics persist.  Quintero did run into some trouble when first promoted to high A, but he improved once he had a few weeks at the level and balanced back into his standard profile with slightly less power.  Quintero has a higher power upside than Beavers, but Beavers has a better hit tool and thus safer floor - combined with proximity gives Beavers the edge in my rankings.",18,50/55,60/65,50/60,60/65,
14,19,Colt Emerson,SS/3B,Mariners,Early 2026,Bigger Brendan Donovan w/ more power potential,"Great hit tool for his age and plate skills for a big lefty who is still developing and has some solid wheels.  He still hasn’t developed the doubles power into homer power, but the transition is occurring as he’s had 9 bombs and a .508 slug in the second half.  Emerson has been reported to have a 115 max EV this year and did record a 112 max EV this spring, plus he’s carried a solid 104.3 90th percentile EV this season as the power is emerging, though the contact rate has dipped a bit as he increased levels, though he still managed a strong zone-contact.","This kid has moved up levels fast, because he takes professional ABs for his age.  Emerson changed his swing this year, adjusting from a leg kick to a toe tap in an effort to stay back more and better incorporate his lower half to get to more power and we have seen the results as noted through the last 50 games or so and while he still doesn’t get great angles, during this time he has reduced his groundball rate from about 51% to 47%.  He has a plus skill at making contact, but sans the last 50 games he’s below average at generating optimal attack angles, which balances out his hit tool to mid.  It’s possible he has fixed these issues and we are seeing a new Emerson, but only time will tell. There are rumors Emerson could break camp with the Mariners and while he has a very high floor, the ceiling is not as high as Beavers or Quintero as he will not have the steals upside for fantasy baseball.",23,55/65,55/60,50/60,50/55,
15,20,Caleb Bonemer,SS/3B,White Sox,Late 2027,Bobby Witt Jr. light mechanics w/ a potential Gunnar Henderson light outcome,"Great bat speed with an insane eye for his age, Bonemer is a well-built shortstop who may end up moving to third with plus tools across the board.  Bonemer has a quick, powerful swing that reminds me of Bobby Witt Jr. and was one of the high end prep bats picked in the second round last season.  Bonemer has shown a plus ability to control his bat through the zone to get to hit the ball hard at optimal angles with a crazy ability to pull the ball through the air as well in an Isaac Paredes-like manner.  He reportedly has a 105.4 90th percentile EV on the year with a 19.7% barrel rate and 14.3 average launch angle, optimal for line drives - though we don’t have this data at MLB Data Warehouse.","Bonemer has a high ceiling as a guy who I would predict will move off shortstop to 3B eventually with a strong ability to make quality contact at a consistent rate.  He should grow into some more natural power which will turn his doubles power into homer power.  He may ultimately have a higher upside than Colt Emerson with I think greater power and speed potential, though a likely worse hit tool, but Emerson gets the edge thanks to higher proximity and a second half breakout at a higher level than Bonemer.",24,55/60,60/65,55/60,55/60,
16,21,Sal Stewart,1B/3B,Reds,Debuted,Manny Machado light,"Big dude who should develop more power, but for now has a fantastic plate approach and hit tool for his age.  He’s been one of my guys since 2023 when I had a live look on him in Jupiter, Florida.  He might end up moving off the position to first full-time, because he’s a big boy.  He has a plus hit tool (potentially plus, plus with his great angles), plus plate skills, an ability to get to some killer angles with an all fields approach and mid-to-upper 20s home run power potential.","Stewart is a bigger dude and I don’t see him stealing more than 10 bags as he’s a good baserunner with below average speed, just as I don’t really see him spending a lot of time at 2B despite him leaning out.  He’s a nice, well-rounded player and has continued to develop a better and better hit tool and power tool as he has advanced levels. Stewart is an incredibly safe player and I bumped him even mid-write up from 27 to 21 ahead of Carson Benge as I jumped his hit tool to a potential 70 grade - which gives him the edge over Benge who has five tool potential.",36,60/70,55/60,55/60,45/40,
17,22,Carson Benge,OF,Mets,Early 2026,Evan Carter / Colton Cowser mash up,"Benge is an athletic OF who was a two-way player in college and hits to all fields.  He’s raw since he’s transitioning from being a two-way player, but there’s a lot of upside to open up now that he’s only focusing on hitting.  Benge has a good ability to make contact and get to barrels, but doesn’t have the most consistent launch angles.  He has a spray profile like JJ Wetherholt that will likely result in more doubles than homer power, but he was improving through the year from the beginning to the end.","Benge is an interesting player who I think has 20/20 upside with a good batting average and while he hasn’t completely eliminated the splits concerned I was worried about earlier in the year, he has definitely improved upon these concerns and I believe has locked himself into a full-time (non-platoon role) heading into the 2026 season sans some unforeseen signings by the Mets. I jumped Emerson and Bonemer over Benge despite Benge being great at the end of the year as Emerson has continued his power uptrend with a very strong second half and Bonemer has a higher ceiling than both - high enough that to me it outweighs the proximity of Benge.",22,55/60,55/60,55/55,55/55,
18,23,Josue De Paula,OF,Dodgers,Mid/Late 2027,Lefty Jordan Walker that can actually get the ball in the air,"Big kid has a body that power can grow into with a solid hit tool as he already produces above average contact rates and plus angles.  De Paula has a great eye, but is a little too passive at the plate with only a 37% swing rate.  The power should develop further as he grows into his big 6’ 3” frame, he’s only maxed out at a recorded 108.5 EV (Future’s Game homer), but has a 105.8 90th percentile EV, which is very good.","De Paula has a long way to go in his power development, but the frame and the 90th percentile EVs are on track.  A more aggressive approach at the plate could lead to more strikeouts and less walks, but could also lead to more damage created and a higher batting average.  The sub par angles and the lack of aggression will limit his ultimate upside until he can grow into these tools, hence the drop in my rankings where I recognize the upside, but am hesitant due in him fulfilling the upside based on a lot of guys failing with similar approaches of late ala the aforementioned Jordan Walker.",13,50/55,55/60,45/65,55/55,
19,25,Travis Bazzana,2B,Guardians,Mid 2026,Daniel Murphy with more athleticism and quickness,"Bazzana has the killer Oregon State hit tool and has professional experience already with wood bats, playing in Australia as a pro while he was a teenager.  He has power and speed, but to what degree will both show up as a pro is the big question to me, as the game power just appeared in 2024 and is relatively a newer tool.  The contact rates are above average and he hits to excellent doubles power angles with a 31% line drive rate, though he also hits the ball on the ground too much and has a well below average air pull rate.","Bazzana will always be compared with JJ Wetherholt since the Guardians picked him first overall and may have a tad more power and speed potential to Wetherholt, but Wetherholt has a stronger hit tool and a grade better plate approach.  The injuries and lack of game power thus far are pulling Bazzana down and De Paula only gets a slight edge to Bazzana due to his age-to-level bump and the higher power potential.",16,50/60,55/60,50/55,60/60,
20,28,Bryce Eldridge,1B,Giants,Debuted,Taller Matt Olson with more gaps in the hit tool to work on,"Big time power potential at a huge 6’ 7” 223 lb., but he needs to close the gaps in his swing in order to avoid being over exposed to strikeouts.  He’s done a much better job at showing a good eye for walks, but the K rate and swinging strike issues are still existent. The 68.7% contact rate and 81.3% Z-contact% are below average, but the quality of contact is great with a 16.2% barrel rate and a solid 13 degree average launch angle.  The power is legit with a 114.6 max EV and 108.5 90th percentile EV.","Eldridge has big time power potential and the athleticism to rack up doubles in the event San Francisco bay winds hold back the power ala Brandon Belt.  He will have to work through the long swing to close the gaps in his contact%, but San Francisco has been aggressive with him.  He got off to a late start this season due to an injury, but he fought his way all the way up to the majors with 25 bombs in 102 minor league games.  This battle between Briceno and Eldridge is a close one to me, Eldridge has greater power potential and at his age is incredibly impressive (see age adjusted wRC+), but Briceno’s more well rounded approach is more attractive to me longer term.

The power continued forward into this season, but the contact rate decreased from 84% last year to 76.4% this season, but that drop is worth the power uptick if that’s the tradeoff and he has been pushed hard up levels this season - so I expect some rebound once he settles in at the higher levels.  There are also good power angles here as he has a near 50% flyball rate that is not yet factored into the fScores.  Briceno has put up a 114.3 max EV and had a ridiculous 107.5 90th percentile EV in 2024.","He’s big, strong, has a great eye and can make contact, which is why the Tigers are starting to move him away from catcher as this is a guy you want to focus on hitting.  He’s playing a bit young for the level, but unfortunately is a max four category contributor as stolen bases are a complete non-factor in his game, which dumps him behind Bazzana even though he has a potential full grade upside in the power department.",29,50/60,55/60,55/65,30/30,

The hit tool tracks to be above average to plus, keeping in mind he’s still only 18-years-old and he continues to get better the longer he’s at the level.","Rodriguez has a sky high power ceiling at catcher / DH and is a little short to move off position to 1B.  He’s a solid, but not fantastic defender at catcher with a good arm and may see some time in LF or 3B at some point just based on the Cardinals catching depth so there may be a Josh Donaldson-like move around the field.  I have seen a lot of Rainiel Rodriguez in person and every time I see him the plate approach and contactability improve, so there’s no reason to think he won’t develop into a power hitting stud.  The hit tool and plate approach launch his potential over many guys with way better proximity, but not enough to bump him ahead of Eldridge (who is already in the majors and has 7-8 inches of height on Rodriguez) or Briceno who is a similarly talented hitter with a bigger body and a more developed hit tool vs. the power / quality angle profile of Rodriguez.",40,50/60,60/65,55/70,40/35,

He hits the crap out of the ball and had some of the highest exit velocities in the 2024 draft.  Waldschmidt is a little overly passive for someone who has some insane tools statcast wise (ala Lars Nootbaar), but thankfully he has increased his in-zone aggressiveness since my last ranking of him, though he still is not as aggressive as I would like.  The line drive rate is an insane 31.3% at AA as he also gets to optimal angles.  Waldschmidt has plus power with a 109 mph 90th percentile EV and 112.5 max EV.","I always love when guys walk more than they strikeout and Waldschmidt is a guy who can possibly do this through the minors.  I expect Waldschmidt to debut at some point next year and if his development continues to a league average hit tool, combined with his natural athleticism and batting eye would make him a potential All Star level player. Rodriguez has a safer hit / power combo despite being younger than Waldschmidt and thus gets the edge in my rankings even though I don’t expect any speed out of him as he has a progressively elite hit / power combo.",31,45/50,65/65,55/65,55/60,

Baez has mashed with a max EV of 114.4 in 2023 and in 2025 he has recorded another 114 EV bomb.  He ran a 106.6 90th percentile EV in 2023 and we don’t have all the numbers for what he has done this year, but he has 30/30 type tools if he can put the hit tool together.  The contact rates continued to improve throughout the season and was over 80% from August 1st onward as he finished the season with homers in three consecutive games.","Baez has had a roller coaster minor league career after a very strong 2022 season, but a rough 2023 and 2024 kind of made him fall off the prospect rankings table - until this season, where he is definitely back!  He has no splits troubles and there’s a chance the hit tool could trend to above average based on the linear progress he made in 2025.  Baez changed his stance to be more upright as the season progressed ala Byron Buxton and notched a .301/.401/.537 slash with 8 bombs in his final 150 PAs.",85,45/55,50/50,60/65,65/60,

The Royals are the masters at developing stud catchers it would seem - with the Cardinals.  He has some solid pull power while also showing the ability to hit the ball the other way, which should keep him from getting shifted to death.  Jensen notched a subpar 73.8% contact rate on the season, but a very good 86.4% Z-Contact and he makes good quality contact within the zone as evidenced by his 16.3% barrel rate and 107.3 90th percentile which has resulted in an insane 59.6% hard hit rate at AAA and an over 23% line drive rate, so while he has below average contactability, the quality of contact is excellent and boosts his overall hit tool.","Jensen’s walk rates increased as he moved up levels, but unfortunately for aggression's sake his swing rates decreased in turn without much of a drop in K rates.  Jensen hits the ball consistently hard and even in his major league small sample size was hitting the ball hard and hitting to optimal angles with new max EVs which push his power potential up to over plus.  While Jensen has the proximity and has shown more consistent angles to Baez to date, Baez actually has better contact rates and has a big time edge in the speed category.",69,55/55,50/55,55/65,50/45,

He has non-zero power and because he has a quick swing can get to a surprising number of extra base hits.  He has a max 108.4 EV in a small sample size of statcast data this year and could run into a couple 20 homer seasons, but will likely live in the 15 homer range who can steal 30-40 bags.","Jett is an interesting player who should have some position flexibility and has a bit of a mighty mouse in him despite the smaller stature.  If he can get to a league average hit tool, the advanced plate approach and speed will carry him to fantasy relevance, however he needs to improve efficiency on the basepaths in order to get a forever green light.  There’s proximity here, but I’ll take Jensen’s banked attack angles and EVs to the speed and better plate skills of Williams.",43,45/50,60/60,45/55,60/60,
27,37,Bryce Rainer,SS,Tigers,Late 2027,Lefty Carson Williams mechanics with a better hit tool and plate skills,"Big lefty bat with a nice stroke that should lead to an average hit tool with very good line drive angles (11.1% barrel rate and 23% line drive rate, though he did hit the ball on the ground too much and has poor air pull rate, which could limit his power upside).  He has already shown plus power at the plate with an elite 90th percentile EV of 107.9 and a max EV of 111.6 with some wheels to boot.  He was also a pitcher and has a killer arm, so should be a prime defender as well.  Sans injury, Rainer might have worked his way into the top 20 prospects by year’s end, so now is the time to buy before he has a ridiculous Spring Training and everyone remembers him.","The eye is solid with a 21.7% chase rate and there are no split concerns as he’s actually hit lefties better than righties with a nice reverse split hitting .318/.462/.500 against lefties.  Rainer has been completely overshadowed by Konnor Griffin, but he is a very good prospect in his own right and could be a nice dynasty value since he’s avoided all the hype of some other similarly successful prep prospects.  His EVs are impressive and his ability to get to barrels, but he needs more consistency in his angles in order to optimize his offensive profile. Jett Williams gets the edge primarily only because of about a two year proximity gap.",35,40/50,50/60,55/65,50/55,

Culpepper is running an average contact rate at 76% and is running a reported 105.9 90th percentile EV with a 110.3 max EV on the season.  Culpepper has a slight reverse split, however the approach and power doesn’t change much - so this may just be a coincidence.  His ability to hit to angles is more or less below average at an average 10 degree LA, but he has hit to a near 50% groundball rate; though his flatter swing path should lead to more line drives and less ground balls as he continues to develop.","Culpepper has gone from a solid potential starter to a near guaranteed major league regular who will have fantasy value as an above average across the board player in the mold of a Dansby Swanson (who was my comp at the beginning of the year and that has really carried forward).  He’s a safe 15/20 bet with who will hit .230-.270 in the majors while he is in his 20s and unlike other Twins prospects, he has yet to have a major injury slow him down as of this writing… I just knocked on wood.  Culpepper gets some points for proximity and for being well rounded, but some of the guys with more unique / elite tools get the edge for me this go around, for example, Bryce Rainer’s power potential.",34,45/50,55/60,55/55,60/55,

He has some wheels as well and projects out as a very well rounded player as long as the hit tool continues to develop as he ages through the levels. The 78.9 Contact% is actually excellent compared to most of the DSL players and he walked more than he struck out, so you have to love the hit profile.  The only exit velocities available are that he has a reported 104 90th percentile EV in the DSL this year, which is fantastic for his age.","Gonzalez was widely seen as the top international signee from last year and has firmly established himself as a legit dude after the DSL season this year.  It will be fun to track him next year, as he could be on a Made-esk track if the Giants place him in low A to start the season (though it should be noted the Giants have been relatively conservative in promoting their prospects outside of Bryce Eldridge).  Gonzalez is raw as a DSL guy, but I think he ultimately has higher upside than Willits thanks to the power, providing a more well rounded profile with big time star potential.

We basically have no EV data on Willits publicly available since 2024, so there’s no point to repeat those numbers.  There’s not a ton of public data yet, so I’m going to get a lot on feel from the video we have available and small sample sizes.  The contact in his debut is what really stands out.","Willits should be a very solid across the board player and will be on my rankings for the next 3-4 years or so as he makes his way levels, so hopefully in 2-3 years I’m not writing about prospect fatigue on him.  His rank is based more on my gut feel and projecting off not a lot of video, rather than hard data and a ton of video / in-person looks.  The good thing is, I should get to see him a decent amount next Spring Training.  Willits likely has a bit more upside than Culpepper, but with limited data and Culpepper’s massive proximity edge, he gets the nod in the pecking order.",55,50/60,45/55,35/45,60/60,

He has plus, plus speed, but he is not the greatest baserunner, having been caught stealing 25 times this year.  I don’t have a full ticket of exit velocity data on George, but he has recorded a 108 max EV this year after recording a max 104 last year in high school.  The biggest concern is the angles are geared toward doubles and gap power, rather than home run power.","It should be noted George does have some reverse platoon issues hitting only .208/.328/.283 against lefties.  George has a lot of potential and has demonstrated above average contactability and plate skills for his age, but needs to work on angles and his baserunning to maximize his skillset.  He’s a high risk, high reward type based on his current profile, but he has extremely high upside thanks to a great hit tool in line with some of the top 2025 draftees like Willits.",113,50/60,45/55,30/45,55/70,

There’s room for a ton of projectability as he adds muscle to the frame and develops the hit tool for better attack angles.","Kilby might have an ultimately safer profile to George being a more efficient runner with higher power potential, but George has done it for a year in pro ball and has proven to have a solid to plus hit tool over the full course of a season, which gives him the edge - plus one year in a proximity boost.  On the other side of the coin, I jumped Kilby over Ralphy based on the potential to be a five tool player while Ralphy as a corner guy does not have the speed component to his game, limiting his fantasy upside.",N/A,45/55,50/60,45/60,60/65,

The hit tool is tracking to be a solid above average.  We don’t have 2025 statcast data, but last season Ralphy notched a max EV of 115 including a 105 90th percentile EV and 16% barrel rate showing he can get to optimal angles all under the age of 20.  His second half slash between both levels was .325/.406/.581 with 10 bombs.","Velazquez was the Guardians first round pick, so this isn’t coming out of nowhere, but he has been especially impressive in CPX and A ball in 2023 and after a rough 2024 has rebounded for a very nice 2025 season, improving his ability to limit strikeouts at a very manageable 14.3% K rate in the second half which boosted his total slash and ability to create damage.

Lombard added some muscle to his 6’ 2” frame this offseason, but it hasn’t resulted in much of a power uptick as of yet.  He’s a doubles guy right now, but could grow into more power as he has reportedly hit the ball over 110 mph, though the highest max EV on record is 108.4 and his 90th percentile from 2024 when we had data was 102.4, but is likely higher post muscle spurt.","Lombard was mashing high A with a .329/.505/.488 line, but has struggled a bit since making the transition to AA as a 20-year-old to a still solid 103 wRC+.  Age-to-level a 50-65 point bounce is fair, as Lombard’s adjustments to AA and a hopeful increase in power production are key indicators for his future value moving forward.  He hasn’t really put up the numbers you would like to see, but tools wise and under the hood he’s been impressive on an age to level basis.

Come for the super high EVs for his age and stay for the productively aggressive hit approach that results in a fair number of barrels.  He did have a rough second half after being traded from the Phillies to the Twins, but he’s a catcher and we should remember he had to learn an entire new pitching staff and is responsible for a lot more than standard position players.  A young catcher getting traded mid-season isn’t exactly easy, so we should provide some grace on his post trade numbers from 2025.","Tait has put up some incredibly impressive numbers for this age and I love the swing and power.  He’s also good defensively as someone who got eyes on him at A ball this season, hanging in to catch Andrew Painter.  There is a little bit of a split concern, as he is not good against lefties and as a lefty catcher it means he might have kind of a strong-side platoon thing going on once he’s in the majors, but catchers sit a couple days a week anyway, so maybe it doesn’t even really affect his total per season plate appearances compared to other starting catchers.",42,50/60,30/40,55/70,30/30,

He likely has a higher power upside than his father (recording a 111 mph max EV already), but will hit for lower averages, as he’s running a very poor 57.4% contact rate through his first 78 PAs in pro ball.  It’s funny people are freaking out about the hit tool already and I would be lying if I didn’t say the terrible contact rate is at least slightly concerning, but we are talking about a guy who has a crazy support system working out with his brother and dad all offseason.  Let’s chill a bit on the pessimism.","Holliday has dropped to fifth in my FYPD rankings after the debut, so while again I preach patience with him, I’m also not going to sit on my laurels so while I have dropped him a little, I’ve seen some people dropping him out of the Top 100 and out of their top 10-15 in the FYPD rankings.

He hits the ball very hard with a reported 116 max EV and a 106.3 90th percentile EV this season and","Montes killed it in low A last season and then struggled when he was first bumped up to high A, but he did finish the season strong.

The baserunning did not match the speed this year, but there is more potential than what we have seen on the back of the baseball card.  Sirota ran a 189 wRC+ on the season and has only played at levels where he is above or at the average age.

Arroyo has recorded up to a 109.7 max EV in 2025 and we don’t have barrel or launch angle data on him, but the 23.7% line drive rate, under 35% groundball rate and reports of consistent hard contact with doubles power lead us to the conclusion he’s a plus angles hitter with an above average hit tool.

It’s tough to judge him when he’s popping in for pinch hits instead of starting and it may just take a little time for him to warm up, but the minor league numbers show us a solid player on the field when he’s healthy with more room to grow in his power potential.  The keys for Lawlar are health, learning to hit off speed pitches and regular playing time.  The health is what drops him to this spot in my rankings and I nearly placed him below Spencer Jones because of his lack of health, but Jones’ hit tool is just so bad that I’m not sure he can make it in the majors - he’s such a wild card.",17,45/50,45/55,50/60,65/65,

The contact part of the hit tool is bad, but the quality of contact is great as he has a 17.9% barrel rate and 14 degree average launch angle on the season, which is the only reason I give him a potential 40 grade on the hit tool. Developing a consistent (even if below average) contactability is what he will live or die by in the majors.","He has changed his stance a number of times this season which has lead to major inconsistencies from week to week, with a .181/.274/.250 slash in his last 19 games and he had hit .423/.478/.962 in the 19 games prior to that.  At the end of the day, the stats look good, but it’s a weird journey to get there and it might not be fun in a weekly H2H league.  He’s basically the living, breathing risk reward line for “go big or go home.”",72,30/40,35/35,60/75,60/60,
46,54,Franklin Arias,SS,Red Sox,2028,Righty Luis Arraez with a tad more power potential and better glove,"Good plate skills with above average power, really quick bat speed and hands and great speed.  He has an elite hit tool, one of the best in the minors with a 89.5 Contact% in high A.  He’s also shown the ability to steal some bags and has non-zero power with the power actually improving at high A from low A.  The highest recorded max EV for Arias is only 105, but that was also back when he was at A ball and we had those readings, while he has an average-ish for his age 102.6 90th percentile EV.  He has at least an average ability to get decent angles on the ball with a solid doubles profile, but has yet to translate that to homerun power.","I learned my lesson by only ranking Jacob Wilson in the 60s… don’t underestimate an advanced hit tool in young guys that could still add power or speed.  He has a 105 wRC+ in high A as a 19-year-old, with which an age-to-level bump would give him another 50 points.  The speed potential has unfortunately fallen off this year, but I think there could be 10-15 homer upside for a guy who should be a consistent .280 plus hitter.  Having Arias ranked right next to Spencer Jones is hilarious because they are polar opposite players, but I give Jones the nod based on proximity and that the power/speed tools are just more tantalizing for most fantasy baseball leagues.",22,65/70,55/60,35/45,40/40,

He’s shown a really strong hit tool (82.8% contact rate and 85.6% Z-contact) and has some unrealized power in his small sample size at the minor league level (107 90th percentile EV and 110 max EV).  The pull power from his college days and the ability to mash extra base hits regularly is tantalizing, but he needs to show some health and stay on the field to realize his potential.","DeLauter just can’t stay healthy and that’s tanked his prospect profile a bit for me.  Every time he’s healthy and I think I’m back in on him, he gets hurt again.  If he could stay healthy he has a .270-.280 profile with 25 homerun upside plus a ton of doubles power.  If he didn’t have the health issues, he would be up in the 30s of my prospect rankings, but I do still like him and the fact he was on the Guardians post-season roster means he should break camp as a starter in 2026.",60,55/60,65/65,55/60,40/40,

He tends to coil up as the pitch is coming in and unleashes to make some nice driving contact that I think will lead to a big doubles profile.  The hit tool has been down this year from 80% in 2024 to 65.4% in 2025, but the slug has been up as he hit three doubles in a row once he returned from injury.  Farmelo had a 103.2 90th percentile EV in 2024 as a 19-year-old and he has hit to excellent angles when healthy.","Farmelo missed the second half of the season in 2024 after suffering a right knee injury that required surgery and then missed a large part of 2025 with a couple more injuries.  We haven’t seen the speed this year or the hit tool, but his previous outcomes have shown these skills exist.  This is almost a good, but injury riddled tier between Farmelo and Emmaneul Rodriguez.

He has quick hands and changed his stance from a slight crouch to be more upright since last year, but those Ks need to go down for him to reach his potential as a 20/20 type with a good walk rate in the majors.  He does have a high quality of contact which balances out the terrible general contact rates as he’s running a 40.6 SweetSpot%, 12% barrel rate, 25.6% line drive rate and 107 90th EV which are all phenomenal.  The power is plus as he hits the ball hard consistently with great angles when he does make contact and has put up an 111.7 max EV.","The power and speed skills are both still intact and his ability to take a walk, but the contact rates have always been horrendous.  The good news is he will get playing time because the defense is phenomenal and the power / speed will play, I bumped him over Emmanuel Rodriguez since he is already in the majors and I think he just generally hits to better angles which bumps his hit tool in my mind via quality of contact.",62,35/40,40/45,60/60,60/60,

He has a nice sized athletic build and should develop into a power / speed threat.  He played SS in highschool, but with a weak arm has moved off to the OF.  The hit tool is performing better than I had expected out of the gate with a 74.3% contact rate and only a 8.8% SwStr%, while he’s shown a fantastic eye at the plate, but he has been a little too patient with only a 34.3% Swing%.  He’s been getting to better angles this year with a plus air-pull rate, as he’s also lowered the groundball rate and increased the linedrive rate.  I have not found publicly available max EVs since high school, but this year he has a reported 103.2 90th percentile EV, which is good for his age.","Gillen is a bit of a flier as a high school athlete in a system that can get crowded with Tampa, but there is a good power / speed skill set here that will play up in this system if he can develop the hit tool - as a lot of Rays guys have good power and speed and never develop the plus hit tool.  His plate approach and angles will help the hit and power tool play up and he has been a burner on the basepaths this year despite rookie reports of only above average run times.  I spotted Gillen between DeLauter and E Rod (the injured bros), because I think DeLauter has a very safe profile if he can ever stay on the field while E Rod has louder tools, but there’s a chance he’s a faster Miguel Sano.",112,40/50,60/65,40/55,60/60,

Like many of these guys, Rodriguez has to work on his hit tool a bit and cut down on the strikeouts.  The power and speed potential is ridiculous, but he has not been able to get anywhere near his potential thanks to injuries, inconsistencies and strikeouts as the contract rate has not been able to develop (66.7% contact rate and 76% Z-Contact%).","He’s dealt with injuries the last couple of years, but has been good on a per plate appearance basis, despite too many strikeouts and a high three outcome potential.  Rodriguez is a former top 10 prospect for me who has great potential if he can improve the hit tool and limit the strikeouts.  He’s almost a tempered down version of Spencer Jones, but the lack of a developed hit tool pushes him below guys like Arias and Willits.",25,30/35,55/55,55/65,50/55,

He’s a big time fastball hunter and guys at the higher levels might expose him on breakers.  He has a long body, but keeps his hands in so he doesn’t get exposed inside.  He smashes pitches up in the zone and it will be interesting to see if he can keep the strikeout rate down as he’s only making contact on 68.4% of his swings and this has downticked since he reached AA, however the contact he is making is with excellent angles as he has a 28% line drive rate on the season and a 49% pull rate.  Condon put up some killer EV numbers in college, but I don’t have any sure things in pro ball.","Condon’s home/away college splits are incredibly concerning amongst the rumors of SEC teams using a live feed in the dugout when at home (.482/.530/1.125 HOME vs. .279/.367/.698 ROAD).  Thankfully we are finally starting to see what he can do healthy this year after a terrible transition to the minors in 2024 and while there is some volatility in the contact profile, the angles he’s showing are a pleasant surprise.

The hit tool is plus or better and the plate skills are improving.  We may also get 10-15 homer power to go along with the rest of the tools, once he improves his ability to get to quality contact.  Crawford has an 84.7% contact rate and 91.4% Z-Contact rate along with an over 65% Z-swing - so the hit tool is very solid.  The crazy thing is his raw power is also not bad, despite no homers, because he is not barreling balls (only 3.1%) and hitting the ball on the ground more than 60% of the time.  He has decent 103.1 90th percentile and 110.6 max EV this year.","Crawford has performed like a stud leadoff hitter at an advanced level for his age throughout his time in the minors.  The lack of power in his profile will stop him from ever reaching the top level of prospects, but he’s projected as an effective source of speed and batting average for the future and could get into 15 homer power if he can translate his raw power into game power (needs to improve angles and get the ball off the ground).  Condon gets the edge with his power upside, but Crawford is underrated and could be the next iteration of the speed guys like Victor Scott to hit the majors and should be up this season, but first needs to get more quality angles and also needs to improve efficiency on the basepaths.",47,60/65,50/55,35/45,60/70,

Morales has a reported 102.6 90th percentile EV which is good at his age and when you combine his projected growth as a big 6’ 3” kid with the optimal angles he gets to there is a lot of power upside here.","It’s hard to rate the younger complex / DSL guys, but Morales is up to A ball now and it should be noted the plate skills have actually improved from complex to A ball.  There’s a lot of potential here with Morales and skills-wise I like him better than guys like Condon, but the proximity gives and raw hit tool that needs a lot of refining (unlike a guy like Edward Florentino) bump him below some rough around the edges proximity guys like Spencer Jones and Condon.",114,30/45,30/50,45/65,50/50,

Rodriguez has a much improved plate approach this season and above average power (106.1 90th percentile EV and 110.7 max EV) and a potential 20/10, gap hitter profile that can really boom in Cincinnati.  He’s good enough against lefties to avoid the strongside platoon risk many lefties face.","The biggest issue Rodriguez faces is a lack of barrels that leads to inconsistencies across his batted ball profile that diminishes would could be a 65 hit tool and a sure fire 55 grade power as the batted ball spread is all over the map, though he still tends to find the gaps and pile up a number of liners.  Parker has a higher upside than Rodriguez, though Rodriguez is close to the majors and gets some proximity bump; the difference is a potential All Start in Parker vs a guy I expect to end up as a solid regular, but not a major DUDE in Rodriguez.",109,60/60,50/55,50/55,45/45,

The 90th percentile EVs he posted 2024 were 102.5.  The hit tool will get him to the bigs and if the power develops, it will make him an All Star.","Crisantes was looking to make a big rise on the list, but he’s missing the rest of 2025 to get shoulder surgery, which will likely delay his debut for an additional season and could stifle the development of his power tool.

I admittedly wasn’t the biggest fan of the profile this offseason due to the lack of extra base hits, but the power has appeared this year with a 104.7 90th percentile EV and exceptional 27.5% line drive rate which has brought about the extra base hits in 2025, including a great 110.8 max EV for a 20-year-old middle infielder - though is quality of contact is still only below average to average.","Escobar is a solid to above average player who profiles as a good second baseman, who could jump to plus hit and power tools as he develops further that would boost him to more of a Ketel Marte light type of ability, because the EVs are great for his age.

The plate skills are elite and help the below average hit tool play up a bit (69.9 Contact% and 75.1 Z-Contact%), but despite lower end contact the quality of contact is fantastic as he’s rocking a 12.8% barrel rate and 15 degree average launch angle on the year.

He’s more athletic than he looks as such a big dude and is pretty solid behind the plate.  He may move to secondary DH or 1B duties at some point ala Salvador Perez to keep the power bat in the lineup, but he has enough defensive skill to stick at the position.  He slots behind Baez since Baez adds the speed upside and proximity to the table and ahead of Irish, who has the better hit tool and contact stroke, but Duno ultimately has a much better eye and a higher power outcome, plus will likely stick to catcher unlike Irish.",153,40/45,55/60,55/70,40/30,

The issue for Ballesteros is he does not have the height to play 1B nor the athleticism to play in the OF, so he’s basically stuck as a catcher / DH option only, which limits his offensive potential from a playing time perspective and the Cubs have some decent options this year at catcher.",64,60/60,50/50,55/55,25/20,

He hits the ball hard frequently, but needs to get the ball into the air to maximize his profile.  Ballesteros gets the call over Caceres right now due to the proximity bump, even without a position at the moment and I’d go Caceres over Rojas because of the stronger power potential.",N/A,50/60,55/60,50/60,40/45,

He needs to get the ball in the air and despite having a good feel for finding the holes in the defense, the power is still down post injury as is the hit tool (73.2 contact%), so I think he has lost some bat speed recovering from the broken hamate last year.

I believe in the talent and don’t want to ding him too much, even though the production hasn’t been what I would have hoped for, but it’s hard to hate on a 109 wRC+ from a guy who is still a little young for the level by two years 35-50 points.",47,35/45,40/50,40/55,55/60,

The hit tool has fallen off from 77.7% contact at AAA to 67% contact in the MLB, which is partly due to a lack of consistent playing time.  Rushing is not a 38% K guy, that will decline once the small sample size is neutraled out.  The power has measured greater in the majors than at AAA with a 112 max EV against the 108 he had in AAA, while he consistently hits the ball hard with an average EV over 90.","Rushing is still a decent prospect, but the Dodgers tend to let some of their guys stew and he’s older for the level.  He’s played games at LF and at 1B in the minors, but has only played catcher for the Dodgers thus far, so it appears unlikely he plays at either of those positions pending an injury.  The Dodgers roster crunch dings him in my rankings a bit and caps his potential, but he’s a solid bat all around.  Rushing has the ability to hit 25-30 bombs in a season if he gets full-time at bats, but the hit tool is worse than what he was credited for once promoted and he needs consistent at bats to finish / polish off his development.

Level does have power potential if he can work on angles as he’s logged max exit velocities of 111.8 and 112 this year, which is potential above plus at his age.","Level has plus tools across the board and is getting into some very nice power for a kid who is barely 18-years-old with a 100.7 90th percentile exit velocity in the DSL as a 17-year-old.  He’s oddly run some lower BABIPs in DSL and CPX, which the opposite is usually the case, but part of that is he has had some low line drive rates at both levels - so it will be interesting to see his barrel numbers once that data is available.  I’m not the biggest fan of Arquette and think there’s a lot of moving parts without elite feature in a sub part hit package.",145,45/50,50/60,35/60,55/55,

We’ve only seen a small sample size in the minors thus far (17 games), but as a longer lever player he has a subpar hit tool that only got to average-ish angles (but the ability to go to all fields) with a metal bat and has hit too many balls on the ground in his small sample size.  Arquetter reportedly has posted a max EV of 104 with wood in the Cape Cod league last year and he ranked in the 92nd percentile of EVs in college last year - indicating a potential plus hit tool.","I’m not as big on Arquette as others are (as you can see based on my ranking), I don’t necessarily buy the power upside as more than mid 20s, because he doesn’t get to the best angles and he has a decent number of holes in his swing.

Montero has a potential plus plate approach with the rare higher walk rate than strikeout rate in his second go at the DSL, chopping his swinging strike rate more than half from last year.  The contact rate is a rough 67.3%, but even a super hit tool guy like Juneiker Caceres bumped his contact rate from 72% to 84% once he hit complex, so there’s a likelihood of a big jump once Montero gets state-side.  Montero has a strong pull/air approach having jumped his pull rate more than 20% year over year, so we are seeing a ton of angles growth this year.  Montero has a reported 104.7 90th percentile EV and 87.5 average EV, which are both great for his age, demonstrating some plus power upside.","Montero is a long way off, hence how far down my rankings he is despite how much I like him.  He was the most consistently great player week-to-week in the DSL this year as I was doing my weekly Top 10 player articles for Fantasy Pros and as you can see, he compiled excellent stats across the boards - it would be great to see him take the jump to A ball next year rather than getting stuck in Complex.

Rodriguez had a reported 90th percentile EV of 103.1 in 2024 in youth Dominican leagues as a 16-year-old and we have no data on how his exit velocities may have improved this year, but there’s 30 homer potential in this bat.  The Tigers paid Rodriguez a $3.2 million bonus, so they obviously like the potential.","Unlike Montero, while Rodriguez is a year younger and that counts for something, the plate approach is lacking with a classic DSL aggressiveness in his profile.  There’s a 30/15 type profile here in his peak if Rodriguez develops properly and cuts the swing and miss, though like Montero he’s years away and this is just my little DSL pocket in these rankings.",N/A,25/50,20/40,40/60,50/50,

The power for Estrada is developing as he’s been getting to better angles at AA dropping the GB rate closer to 40% and raising the flyball profile.  He hits the ball harder than you would think for a small dude, getting to a 112 max EV earlier this year and reportedly hitting 102 90th percentile EVs in the 2024 season, which based on these numbers and the change in attack angles, he has a lot more power to grow into.","I love Estrada’s swing, high hands, simple toe tap in the box and a nice load that gets him into way more power than you think he would be capable of and reminds me of a mini switch hitting Shohei Ohtani.  Estrada is rocking a 138 wRC+ on the season and is more than two years young for the level, so deserves a theoretical bump of another 50-65 points to a 190-ish wRC+, if the power can uptick Estrada could be a Top 100 guy by the offseason rankings.",N/A,50/55,40/45,40/55,65/60,

Ford gets to slightly above average angles as well with an 8.8% barrel rate, 23.2% line drive rate and 9 degree average launch angle this year.  Ford’s power this season has ticked up to average-ish despite hitting way too many balls on the ground as he’s netted a 103.5 90th percentile EV and 109.3 average EV on the season.","Ford is a good athlete so there’s a chance he moves off to the OF where he played a little in 2024.  This year he has only played at catcher and DH and though he might move off a bit, he should keep the catcher designation as the backup to Raleigh even if it’s not his primary position in the bigs.  He should get a September call up based on his performance and the only thing to hate this year is the drop in stolen bases after coming off three consecutive 20+ steal seasons.  Ford has a 127 wRC+ and is still at least one year young for the level, so he theoretically should net an 150 wRC+ when considering age-to-level.  I give Estrada an edge to Ford as I think Estrada has more power potential and Ford being a catcher and not yet playing off position may affect his total ABs ala Dalton Rushing.",133,50/55,65/70,45/45,50/55,

I’m not sure how much I buy that, but it is definitely factored into this ranking and his potential hit tool, though the angles haven’t been great with only a 6.9% barrel rate and 6 degree average launch angle in the small AAA sample size, the AA angles were a bit better, though still only average.  The max EV is only 111, though I’m sure he’s hit it harder when we haven’t had the data based on his profile and his 90th percentile EV is sitting at a very good 107.1 mph.","The power is legit at a young age, he might struggle at times with strikeouts, but he actually does have a good approach with only a 22.6% chase rate at AAA. He needs to swing in the zone more though, as a 52.9% Z-Swing% is way too passive.  I jumped Clifford of Wilken even though I think Clifford is probably at best a 30-35 homer guy based on the lower EVs and worse angles, but he makes much better contact and has a little more athleticism that will raise his batting potential batting average to be a good 20 points higher than Wilken and that matters.

He’s a small dude and will have a limited power upside, but he does have 15 homer power just based on how much hard contact he generates in the smaller frame.  He was a .300 plus hitter on both sides of the plate, so he is a legit switch hitter that will stick with a great hit tool (81.2% contact rate) and solid angles, but ideally the GB% would decrease.  The stolen bases are down this year, as is the power stroke - likely due to his injury or lack of a normal pre-season program.  Interestingly Genao gets close to his max EV pretty regularly having posed a 105 max EV and 104.1 90th percentile EV","The Guardians have a lot of these hit first switch hitting middle infielders and while Genao might be the best of their massive middle infield crop behind Bazzana, they haven’t exactly hit on all of them (see Rocchio and Gimenez).",92,50/60,55/55,45/50,55/60,

His contact rate is up to 72.5%, which is good enough with his power and he has a top notch eye, the strikeout rates should tick down as the swinging strike rate of 9.5% portends to better future outcomes.  Wilken has a near 60% pull rate so the air/pull here is ridiculous for a guy who has put up a 115 max EV and a 108.1 90th percentile EV back in 2023 when we had those numbers for him.","Brock Wilken missed time in 2024 after getting hit in the eye with a pitch and it messed up his entire season.  Don’t get too excited about his low average this year either, as he’s been hitting in the Southern League which is basically the opposite minor league version of the PCL (that or the low A FSL), though Biloxi is about league average in wOBA.

He also hits to good angles and is able to barrel the ball well when he does make contact with a 17.5% barrel rate and 25.8% line drive rate at AAA this year.  There is a lot of power potential here however, it will likely come in a strong-side platoon role, because his numbers against lefties are horrendous with a .225/.355/.371 slash against same-handed pitching.","Caissie has always played young for the level and I expect more power to develop based on the exit velocities, but the hit tool has to catch up in order for this to happen.  These are the major hurdles that will determine whether or not Caissie leans toward good Cody Bellinger production or bad Joey Gallo production, while the EVs keep his prospect status afloat.  A lot of people will have Caissie as a Top 100 guy, but he’s basically all power at this point with a lot of questions in the approach and hit tool - plus he can’t hit lefties, so he’s likely a platoon bat.",118,40/40,30/40,55/70,35/40,

91,142,Cole Carrigg,OF,Rockies,Mid 2026,"Jarren Duran light as a switch hitter, pre-breakout","Ridiculous speed skill set with some pop, but poor contact and plate approach.  The dude is versatile though as a former catcher and has been clocked throwing 102 MPH.  He has a below average hit tool with only a 71.4 contact% this season and only an average ability to get to good angles.  The power isn’t as good as it appears, because he has only hit on the record a max EV of 107.7 and recorded only a 101.7 90th percentile EV in 2024.","There’s a high ceiling here, but tons of questions because Colorado has a terrible development track record.  Ultimately he could have some good seasons in his 20s as the speed will play up as you hope the hit tool and plate skill inch back toward the 40 grades we saw last season.  I’ll take the better hit and speed combo in Coors over the risky hit/plate approach Bitonti brings to the table.",78,35/40,35/45,40/45,65/70,
92,146,Colton Ledbetter,OF,Rays,Mid 2026,Garrett Mitchell,"Ledbetter was the Rays second round pick in 2023 and had a breakout 2024.  He’s a great athlete known for good defense and while there has been a bit too much swing and miss, the ability to do damage is there, despite some power regression in 2025.  There are great tools in this package (113 max EV and a reported 106 90th percentile EV), but some contact (73.7% contact rate & high 17.4 IFFB%) and plate skills questions, despite hitting for some solid angles with a 25.2% line drive rate.  It should be noted he was caught stealing 10 times this season","Ledbetter has shown plus speed this season and the batted ball profile has transitioned almost 1-1 from high A to AA, but the power has fallen off between levels and the profile without power isn’t nearly as interesting for fantasy despite the exit velocity numbers; though we should note he’s playing in the Southern league which is infamously tough for hitters. He’s quite similar as a prospect to Carrigg as both are college hitters in AA with 15/25 or so type potential, but Carrigg gets the boost with better foot speed even though Ledbetter has better power and they both have similar hit and batted ball profiles.",93,40/50,40/45,45/55,60/55,
93,148,Eric Bitonti,1B/3B,Brewers,2028,Shades of Kyle Tucker mechanics mashed with bad Cody Bellinger,"Bitonti has more or less moved off 3B now to 1B and has some big power potential with a little speed mixed in, but the contact rates have not improved year over year and are still at a dismal 65.4%, though he does have a great air/pull rate for power potential factored into quality of contact.  Bitonti has put up a 113 max EV and in 2024 had a reported 105 90th percentile EV, demonstrating some upper level power, but it won’t matter if he’s not making contact.","Bitonti has upside, but obviously a lot of holes in his game as well.  The potential for 30 homers and 10 steals if he can figure out the hit tool is what keeps him in the Top 150, but once you get out of the top 100 there are a lot of guys with extremes in either direction, rather than your well-rounded prospects with good contactability and strong tools.",N/A,30/35,25/40,55/65,45/40,
94,150,Termarr Johnson,2B,Pirates,Mid 2026,"Short Jason Kipnis, might have some Dozier-esk or Brandon Phillips-esk seasons","There’s major prospect fatigue here with Termarr, but he still has tools that will get him to the big leagues.  The hit tool is a tad underrated as he has a 75% contact rate, but he does not put together good angles for quality contact or for generating power.  He has slightly above average speed, but he has not been a good baserunner this year, having been caught stealing 11 times.  Johnson’s highest recorded exit velocity is 106.9 and he’s reportedly netted a 90th percentile EV over 105 which portends to average to slightly above average power once he’s fully developed.","Johnson needs to develop more of a doubles profile to really make it.  He’s still netting a 113 wRC+ at AA and only turned 21 a couple months ago, so he’s still a couple years young for the level which is worth a theoretical bump of 50 points assuming he’s not already capped in his developmental growth.  There’s a chance he could still add a 5 to the potential of all those grades, but he needs to make some significant strides forward instead of continually treading water - even though yes, he’s playing above age to level.  I’ll give BItonti the edge to Johnson thanks to the power upside.",85,40/45,50/55,50/55,50/45,
