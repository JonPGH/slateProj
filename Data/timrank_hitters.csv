0,1,Konnor Griffin,SS/OF,Pirates,Late 2026,Light Fernando Tatis Jr. with an Elly de la Cruz statistical profile,"Griffin is a big righty with a good arm as a high school pitcher and he has some massive power upside. The high stance and high and tight hands in his swing reminds me of Fernando Tatis Jr. and like Tatis, he will probably have plenty of swing and miss to go with the damage. Tools for days here as Griffin has already posted a max EV of 114.2 and has a 90th percentile EV of nearly 108. The hit tool is better than expected, but still might only tune in at slightly above league average as he could do better on the angles ala Elly de la Cruz coming up (52% groundball rate and only 7 degree average launch angle). Griffin was able to get 48 extra bas ts in 122 games in 2025 in addition to the 65 stolen bases on the season.","Griffin has the highest upside of any prospect in baseball and has shown this season to have a much safer hit tool than previously expected after some changes to his batting stance. He could maximize his skillset further by becoming more efficient on the basepaths and improving his bat path for better angles to generate a higher level of quality contact. Griffin seemingly improved upon being promoted from low A to AA throughout the course of the season and while some think he will break camp, I doubt the Pirates will allow him to skip AAA and think the absolute best case scenario for promotion would be June or July sans a team friendly long-term contract.",1,50/55,45/55,60/70,70/70,Y
1,2,Kevin McGonigle,2B/SS,Tigers,Early 2026,"Chase Utley wannabe, but the profile might be more like Nomar Garciaparra","This kid has an insane hit tool and plate skills with developing power. Despite lackluster angles in our limited statcast data available with only a 6.3% barrel rate and a 103.6 90th percentile, he has recorded much higher max EVs to last year constantly touching 111 and reportedly hitting 112 mph. He’s a doubles machine with 31 doubles in only 88 games this year and pretty crazy 52 extra base hits in those 88 games, which has to be the highest XBH / game played in the minores.","It’s hard to show concern for a guy with such a honed hit tool and a nicely developing power stroke, however the speed has taken a dump this year as he went from 22 steals and only 2 caught stealing last year to only 10 steals and 7 times caught stealing this year. There are also some injury concerns I have that nobody wants to discuss, but he only played in 74 games last year after breaking a hamate bone and this year has only played in 88 games after starting the year late from a high ankle sprain. Griffin has a higher power/speed upsides, but in a points league, I’m probably picking McGonigle first overall.",4,60/70,70/70,55/60,45/50,Y
2,4,Samuel Basallo,C/1B,Orioles,Debuted,Kyle Schwarber with a better hit tool,"Solid plate discipline and crazy power for his age, Bassallo has improved as the season has gone on in regards to quality of contact and angles. The dude is built for his age with fast hands, but a tight / weird batting stance. He will likely move off the catcher position full-time because of Rutschman. The contact rates are slightly below average (but we should also be considering his age), but the quality of contact numbers are ridiculous as he’s rocking a 21.5 barrel% and 15 average LA on the season with more line drives and flyballs coming as the season has gone on. Between majors and minors Basallo knocked a ridiculous 50 extra base hits in only 107 games played.","Basallo has massive power potential as he is currently rocking a 108.3 90th percentile EV, 115.9 max EV and 94.2 average EV as a 20-year-old the majority of the season at AAA. He doesn’t have wheels and luckily it sounds like the Orioles have a plan for playing time as a backup C and DH so I wouldn’t worry too much about playing time. He may have the highest age adjusted wRC+ due to his performance way above expected at AAA and the MLB. He is a max four category guy, so that will always limit his fantasy ceiling outside of points leagues.",3,50/60,50/60,65/70,35/40,Y
3,5,JJ Wetherholt,2B/SS/3B,Cardinals,Early 2026,Corbin Carroll / Marcus Semien mash-up,"Wetherholt hits the crap out of the ball for a smaller guy, is athletic and has a great eye at the plate. He has quick, an easy swing and great bat control that will likely lead to an early career high doubles profile that later translates into more power as he gets closer to his peak. Wetherholt has an average EV of 91.4 this season at AAA with a 109.2 max EV to go along with an aggressive in zone approach with a high propensity for quality contact with an 11.9 barrel% and great angles with an aptitude to hit to all fields with a near 25% linedrive rate. Wetherholt hit an impressive 47 extra base hits in only 109 games for the Cardinal.","Wetherholt is probably the most well-rounded prospect in this rankings update and should have a number of .280/.370/.480 seasons in the majors with 20/20 outcomes from what will likely either be second or third base. In AAA he played 12 games at third, 24 games at SS and only 3 games at second base. It will be interesting to see where the Cardinals fit him in around Masyn Winn, the assumption is he plays primarily second base, but I think he has the defensive chops to play third base. Wetherholt has a very high floor and while there are prospects lower in the rankings with a higher ceiling, Wetherholt appears to be a lock as an All Star caliber player and while he doesn’t have an elite tool like Basallo’s power, his super power is consistency in all assets of the game.",6,60/65,65/70,50/55,55/60,Y
4,6,Max Clark,OF,Tigers,Late 2026,Corbin Carroll,"Multi-sport athlete; has a really nice hit tool, a lot of speed and should develop more power as he ages. He’s likely to develop more into a speed first, 15-20 homer type based on the small sample size of what we have seen in the minors and pre-draft, though there is room for growth as his low A max EV last year was 106.7 and he’s recorded up to a 111.2 max EV this year in limited data samples. While the hit tool is already 70 grade from a contact standpoint, it’s subpar in regards to squaring up despite a much improved batted ball profile and angles since getting to AA. My biggest worry is the power tool at this point, especially from a split standpoint where all ten of his homers have come against righties this season, while last year he actually hit lefties better than righties, but he is working hard this offseason to hone his power swing. With his speed, he should be more aggressive on the basepaths. Clark only had 36 extra base hits in 111 games in 2025, but there’s definitely more power upside in his bat.","Clark was drafted primarily for the potential of his tools, but his hit tool and plate skills are the most impressive pieces of his profile right now. He looks like he could be one of the better players in baseball when he makes it to the big leagues - I would like to see him swing more aggressively in the zone, but funny enough the profile almost resembles Riley Greene with slightly less power, but a lot more speed, though he needs to be more aggressive on the basepaths. If Clark can run more and better utilize his speed, he could regain top prospect status prior to graduation.",2,60/70,60/70,45/60,55/70,Y
5,7,Jesus Made,SS,Brewers,Late 2027,Smaller switch-hitting infield Christian Yelich profile and swing mechanics,"We don’t have a lot of statcast data on Made yet, but we have a recorded max EV of 111 at high A and a reported 90th percentile EV of 103.9 with an advanced hit tool on both sides of the plate. Made is a true switch hitter with no split concerns though the slash as a righty is a bit better despite a higher K rate against lefties. Made is aggressive on the basepaths, but needs to clean up the steals game a bit having been caught stealing 13 times this year. Made hit 40 extra base hits in 115 games in 2025, including 16 of which that came in his last 44 games in the second half.","Made’s plate skills and athleticism have been impressive this season and though he has a leaner, but more twitchy type athleticism to him. He’s playing way above age-to-level just like Clark and others like De Vries and Walcott, but has tended to a stronger all around profile with a higher floor and just as high of a ceiling. Most will have Made ahead of Clark and I get it, but Clark is such a beast when it comes to work ethic and I believe the speed for him is all about when he starts aggressively running, not if - still love made obviously as he is a potential future #1 prospect.",8,55/65,55/60,50/60,60/65,Y
6,9,Edward Florentino,OF,Pirates,2028,Lefty Julio Rodriguez with potentially a better hit tool,"Florentino is a big, twitchy lefty with a large stride in his swing and is definitely the largest riser from the last ranking to this one after demonstrating a smooth transition to A ball with a plus to potentially plus, plus hit tool thanks to maybe the best angles in baseball. The power is fantastic and Florentino is the master of fScores with the highest grade of anyone in the minors. Florentino put up a world beating 41 extra base hits in only 83 games in 2025.","The hit tool is only dampered by the fact he could afford to be more aggressive in-zone to avoid Emmanuel Rodriguez syndrome as he climbs the ranks and he does have some trouble against lefties, at least a low A. Florentino has the highest upside to anyone not named Griffin or McGonigle, but we have to keep the fact he’s only played up to low A in tow in order to reign in an accurate ranking. Further proximity also affects this ranking, but he’s still top 10 and may be a future #1 at some point after some guys in front of him graduate.",12,60/70,55/60,50/65,60/60,Y
7,10,Walker Jenkins,OF,Twins,Mid 2026,Larry Walker / OF Freddie Freeman,"Big, strong lefty for his age and one of the top five guys from the 2023 draft class. He has a ton of pull power, but can hit for extra base hits through all fields. Jenkins’ carrying tool thus far has been the combo of his plus hit tool, alongside an above average plate approach, but he has not yet developed the power his big frame should get into and he needs to work on his angles - though the angles and power did improve significantly toward the tail end of the season when he got healthy. Jenkins only played in 84 games in 2025, but hit 29 extra base hits.","It should be noted despite too many injuries, Jenkins has still managed to climb to AAA at the age of 20 and have strong numbers. If he had consistent health he would be seen as a consensus top 10 prospect, but I suspect others will weigh the lack of plate appearances and the back of baseball card stats against him - providing some nice value in dynasty leagues. Jenkins profiles more as a points league darling due to an average to above average expected output in the steals department.",7,60/70,55/65,50/60,55/50,Y
8,11,Luis M. Pena,SS/3B,Brewers,Mid 2027,Righty only Francisco Lindor mechanics meets a light Jose Ramirez skillset,"Pena is a shorter build for a 3B ala Jose Ramirez and has a good hit tool with an 78.5% contact rate that has taken a beating at high A. While you might think I’m crazy to compare Pena to Jose Ramirez, J Ram was basically a non-prospect seen as just a slightly solid player around the board. Pena has a drastic edge on him from prospecting standards and may be available at a discount compared to the industry thanks to some struggles a high A while he hit 33 extra base hits in only 96 games in 2025.","Pena has struggled a bit in his high A small sample size by being too patient, which has resulted in both a lower contact rate and high K rate at the level with only a 37.6% swing rate. If Pena were more aggressive at the plate he would run into better counting stats, but for now as he transitions up levels, though the upside is there we must be a tad hesitant to bump him ahead of higher proximity guys. Jenkins gets an edge to Pena with a higher floor, while they have similar ceilings.",15,55/65,50/55,50/60,60/65,Y
9,12,Aidan Miller,SS,Phillies,Mid 2026,Royce Lewis w/ killer speed and health,"This dude is an athlete, I had a live look on him and he’s really just a super athlete and a gamer. A lot of people thought he would move off SS to 3B, but he looks super smooth and athletic and he should stay at SS as long as he can. He has above average to plus tools across the board with an improved hit tool this year and a great ability to pull the ball in the air plus quality attack angles, but Miller is still pretty raw and seems to run into issues when he gets to a new level, then adapts. He’s young for the level at AAA and with improved athleticism he may be able to stick at SS if the Phillies wanted to move Trea to 2B as he ages, but Miller will likely land at 3B. Miller knocked 43 extra base hits in 116 games in 2025 to go along with the 59 stolen bases.","Miller’s improved hit and speed in 2025 have changed his career arc from being a potential Matt Shaw type to being a level above, he has All Star potential if not greater if he continues to progress at the current rate. Pena has more of a track record in the hit and speed departments and while Miller should get to more power, he has had less consistency in his MILB career, though it’s close because he also has much closer proximity to the majors than Pena. Pena gets a slight edge due to a safer floor.",38,55/60,55/60,55/60,65/60,Y
10,13,Sebastian Walcott,SS,Rangers,Early 2027,"Fernando Tatis Jr. - light, similar build and swing","Super raw, a huge 19-year-old kid with raw power for days (115.1 EV posted this spring). He needs to further develop the hit tool and plate skills, but the tools are there and he debuted at high A as a 17-year-old. He ran an improved hit tool in the second half and hit .323 with an 82% contact rate in the final month of the season, but the power was lacking. Ultimately the raw power and power ceiling are extremely high and he will get to the homers, the concern is if there will be a trade-off in the hit tool to get there. He also walked more than he struck out over this period. Walcott only managed to hit 34 extra base hits in 124 minor league games this year, but the age-to-level factor is real here and we should give him another year to jump forward in power.","The kid is still super raw and we are seeing the talent develop starting mid-season from a set of tools into a baseball player. Walcott is in this middle zone at this point where he has been pushed very hard, very fast by the Rangers as he’s a 3-4 years younger than the average player in AA hence the age adjusted wRC+ of 187 which is higher than anyone else we have looked at in the top of the rankings outside of Samuel Basallo who is now in the majors. Some patience is needed here with Walcott.",10,45/50,50/60,45/65,55/50,Y
11,14,Leo De Vries,SS,Athletics,Mid 2027,Switch hitting Alfonso Soriano at SS,"De Vries has super high upside across the board and is a potential five-tool switch hitting talent who has continually played at a high age-to-level. De Vries is absolutely electric and has a long swing despite quick hands, giving me that Soriano feeling. His contact rates improved after some transition with the Athletics and he gets to good angles. De Vries became more aggressive at the plate with the Athletics with an increased swing rate which will help his hit tool trend to plus considering his age to the level he’s at and he has a max EV at 110, however the 90th percentile is only at 102.1 mph and he has been caught stealing 8 times this year. I do have some splits concerns as he absolutely destroyed righties from the left side, but struggled against lefties from the other side of the plate. De Vries knocked a fantastic 51 extra base hits across only 118 games at a significant age-to-level disadvantage in 2025.","De Vries is a year behind Walcott, but since the two have traversed up the prospect rankings list together as a sort of athletic SS tandem way above age to level it’s hard not to compare them. Ultimately De Vries has better foundational mechanics and appears to have better bat speed, while Walcott is bigger and has a higher power ceiling with more raw athleticism and that’s what gives him the edge when I compare the two.",14,50/60,55/55,50/60,40/50,Y
12,16,Dylan Beavers,OF,Orioles,Debuted,Kyle Tucker mechanics with a Jarren Duran skillset,Big lefty outfielder who killed it in the doubles department last year and is not transitioning some of that into homerun power in 2025. There’s a potential 20/25 player here if he can hit enough to make it work as the 105.4 90th percentile EV and 111.6 max EV portend to at least 20 homer power. The hit tool has progressed dramatically since last season as he now has a well above average 89.5 Z-Contact% and 82.6 Contact% with only a 19.4% chase rate with excellent angles as he has rocked an average 17 degree launch angle this year and solid 9.3% barrel rate; he has a good bat for line drives. Beavers had 44 extra base hits in 129 games across the majors and minors in 2025 with 10 of those coming in 35 major league games.,"Beavers had a very strong 2024 and has only gotten better in 2025. I’ve been one of the higher guys on Beavers the last year or two and I expect him to finish higher on my list than others, as I think his hit tool could be greater than plus and the transition to the majors may depend on a his above average plate approach tracking to plus to see if he can avoid falling into inconsistencies. Beavers has a very high floor thanks to the evolution of his hit tool and while some younger shortstops like De Vries and Walcott have higher ceilings for power the proximity bump and sure hit tool of Beavers draws him a little closer to that higher tier of guys in my ranking than in most.",21,60/65,60/60,55/55,60/55,Y
13,17,Eduardo Quintero,OF,Dodgers,Late 2027,Shades of Wander Franco as an OF with less power and more speed,"Fantastic plate skills (only a 19.4 chase rate in 2024) and a heck of an athlete; Quintero has a solid hit tool with a knack for barreling the ball and brings a ton of athleticism to the plate. He’s taken it to another level this season from a power and speed angle, performing at a now elite level, I just wish I had statcast data on him as the best I have is a reported 106.6 90th percentile EV in 2024, which is killer for last season at 18-years-old. Quintero knocked 48 extra base hits in 113 games in 2025.","The hit tool has room to improve if he can be a little more aggressive in zone to generate more contact. Quintero has top 5, or higher, prospect upside depending on who comes and who goes within the next year or so, as he will probably move up the rankings as long as the production and improvements in the underlying metrics persist. Quintero did run into some trouble when first promoted to high A, but he improved once he had a few weeks at the level and balanced back into his standard profile with slightly less power. Quintero has a higher power upside than Beavers, but Beavers has a better hit tool and thus safer floor - combined with proximity gives Beavers the edge in my rankings.",18,50/55,60/65,50/60,60/65,Y
14,19,Colt Emerson,SS/3B,Mariners,Early 2026,Bigger Brendan Donovan w/ more power potential,"Great hit tool for his age and plate skills for a big lefty who is still developing and has some solid wheels. He still hasn’t developed the doubles power into homer power, but the transition is occurring as he’s had 9 bombs and a .508 slug in the second half. Emerson has been reported to have a 115 max EV this year and did record a 112 max EV this spring, plus he’s carried a solid 104.3 90th percentile EV this season as the power is emerging, though the contact rate has dipped a bit as he increased levels, though he still managed a strong zone-contact. Emerson had 50 extra base hits in 2025 in 130 games, including 25 of his extra base hits in his final 55 games - showing off that significant power uptick in the second half.","This kid has moved up levels fast, because he takes professional ABs for his age. Emerson changed his swing this year, adjusting from a leg kick to a toe tap in an effort to stay back more and better incorporate his lower half to get to more power and we have seen the results as noted through the last 50 games or so and while he still doesn’t get great angles, during this time he has reduced his groundball rate from about 51% to 47%. He has a plus skill at making contact, but sans the last 50 games he’s below average at generating optimal attack angles, which balances out his hit tool to mid. It’s possible he has fixed these issues and we are seeing a new Emerson, but only time will tell. There are rumors Emerson could break camp with the Mariners and while he has a very high floor, the ceiling is not as high as Beavers or Quintero as he will not have the steals upside for fantasy baseball.",23,55/65,55/60,50/60,50/55,Y
15,20,Caleb Bonemer,SS/3B,White Sox,Late 2027,Bobby Witt Jr. light mechanics w/ a potential Gunnar Henderson light outcome,"Great bat speed with an insane eye for his age, Bonemer is a well-built shortstop who may end up moving to third with plus tools across the board. Bonemer has a quick, powerful swing that reminds me of Bobby Witt Jr. and was one of the high end prep bats picked in the second round last season. Bonemer has shown a plus ability to control his bat through the zone to get to hit the ball hard at optimal angles with a crazy ability to pull the ball through the air as well in an Isaac Paredes-like manner. He reportedly has a 105.4 90th percentile EV on the year with a 19.7% barrel rate and 14.3 average launch angle, optimal for line drives - though we don’t have this data at MLB Data Warehouse. Bonemer put up 46 extra base hits in his pro debut season across only 107 games in 2025.","Bonemer has a high ceiling as a guy who I would predict will move off shortstop to 3B eventually with a strong ability to make quality contact at a consistent rate. He should grow into some more natural power which will turn his doubles power into homer power. He may ultimately have a higher upside than Colt Emerson with I think greater power and speed potential, though a likely worse hit tool, but Emerson gets the edge thanks to higher proximity and a second half breakout at a higher level than Bonemer.",24,55/60,60/65,55/60,55/60,Y
16,21,Sal Stewart,1B/3B,Reds,Debuted,Manny Machado light,"Big dude who should develop more power, but for now has a fantastic plate approach and hit tool for his age. He’s been one of my guys since 2023 when I had a live look on him in Jupiter, Florida. He might end up moving off the position to first full-time, because he’s a big boy. He has a plus hit tool (potentially plus, plus with his great angles), plus plate skills, an ability to get to some killer angles with an all fields approach and mid-to-upper 20s home run power potential. Stewart put up a fantastic 60 extra base hits across the majors and minors in 2025 through 136 total games.","Stewart is a bigger dude and I don’t see him stealing more than 10 bags as he’s a good baserunner with below average speed, just as I don’t really see him spending a lot of time at 2B despite him leaning out. He’s a nice, well-rounded player and has continued to develop a better and better hit tool and power tool as he has advanced levels. Stewart is an incredibly safe player and I bumped him even mid-write up from 27 to 21 ahead of Carson Benge as I jumped his hit tool to a potential 70 grade - which gives him the edge over Benge who has five tool potential.",36,60/70,55/60,55/60,45/40,Y
17,22,Carson Benge,OF,Mets,Early 2026,Evan Carter / Colton Cowser mash up,"Benge is an athletic OF who was a two-way player in college and hits to all fields. He’s raw since he’s transitioning from being a two-way player, but there’s a lot of upside to open up now that he’s only focusing on hitting. Benge has a good ability to make contact and get to barrels, but doesn’t have the most consistent launch angles. He has a spray profile like JJ Wetherholt that will likely result in more doubles than homer power, but he was improving through the year from the beginning to the end. Benge notched 47 extra base hits in 116 games this year, including 9 homers in his last 43 games.","Benge is an interesting player who I think has 20/20 upside with a good batting average and while he hasn’t completely eliminated the splits concerned I was worried about earlier in the year, he has definitely improved upon these concerns and I believe has locked himself into a full-time (non-platoon role) heading into the 2026 season sans some unforeseen signings by the Mets. I jumped Emerson and Bonemer over Benge despite Benge being great at the end of the year as Emerson has continued his power uptrend with a very strong second half and Bonemer has a higher ceiling than both - high enough that to me it outweighs the proximity of Benge.",22,55/60,55/60,55/55,55/55,Y
18,23,Josue De La Paula,OF,Dodgers,Mid/Late 2027,Lefty Jordan Walker that can actually get the ball in the air,"Big kid has a body that power can grow into with a solid hit tool as he already produces above average contact rates and plus angles. De Paula has a great eye, but is a little too passive at the plate with only a 37% swing rate. The power should develop further as he grows into his big 6’ 3” frame, he’s only maxed out at a recorded 108.5 EV (Future’s Game homer), but has a 105.8 90th percentile EV, which is very good. De Paula needs to swing more to maximize his tools though as his conservative swing approach only led to 29 extra base hits in 102 games in 2025.","De Paula has a long way to go in his power development, but the frame and the 90th percentile EVs are on track. A more aggressive approach at the plate could lead to more strikeouts and less walks, but could also lead to more damage created and a higher batting average. The sub par angles and the lack of aggression will limit his ultimate upside until he can grow into these tools, hence the drop in my rankings where I recognize the upside, but am hesitant due in him fulfilling the upside based on a lot of guys failing with similar approaches of late ala the aforementioned Jordan Walker.",13,50/55,55/60,45/65,55/55,Y
19,25,Travis Bazzana,2B,Guardians,Mid 2026,Daniel Murphy with more athleticism and quickness,"Bazzana has the killer Oregon State hit tool and has professional experience already with wood bats, playing in Australia as a pro while he was a teenager. He has power and speed, but to what degree will both show up as a pro is the big question to me, as the game power just appeared in 2024 and is relatively a newer tool. The contact rates are above average and he hits to excellent doubles power angles with a 31% line drive rate, though he also hits the ball on the ground too much and has a well below average air pull rate. Bazzana completed the season with 31 extra base hits in 84 games.","Bazzana will always be compared with JJ Wetherholt since the Guardians picked him first overall and may have a tad more power and speed potential to Wetherholt, but Wetherholt has a stronger hit tool and a grade better plate approach. The injuries and lack of game power thus far are pulling Bazzana down and De Paula only gets a slight edge to Bazzana due to his age-to-level bump and the higher power potential.",16,50/60,55/60,50/55,60/60,Y
20,28,Bryce Eldridge,1B,Giants,Debuted,Taller Matt Olson with more gaps in the hit tool to work on,"Big time power potential at a huge 6’ 7” 223 lb., but he needs to close the gaps in his swing in order to avoid being over exposed to strikeouts. He’s done a much better job at showing a good eye for walks, but the K rate and swinging strike issues are still existent. The 68.7% contact rate and 81.3% Z-contact% are below average, but the quality of contact is great with a 16.2% barrel rate and a solid 13 degree average launch angle. The power is legit with a 114.6 max EV and 108.5 90th percentile EV as Eldridge finished the year with 48 extra base hits in the majors and minors across 112 total games.","Eldridge has big time power potential and the athleticism to rack up doubles in the event San Francisco bay winds hold back the power ala Brandon Belt. He will have to work through the long swing to close the gaps in his contact%, but San Francisco has been aggressive with him. He got off to a late start this season due to an injury, but he fought his way all the way up to the majors with 25 bombs in 102 minor league games. This battle between Briceno and Eldridge is a close one to me, Eldridge has greater power potential and at his age is incredibly impressive (see age adjusted wRC+), but Briceno’s more well rounded approach is more attractive to me longer term. However, I pick Eldridge over Briceno in shorter term leagues due to the proximity.",19,45/50,40/45,65/70,30/30,Y
21,29,Josue Briceno,C/1B,Tigers,Early 2027,Joey Votto mechanics,"Huge 6’ 5” catcher who has already started to move off to 1B due to the size and with a plus hit tool and plate skills, while the power came along in the Arizona Fall League in 2024 where he cranked 17 extra base hits, including 10 bombs including a .433/.509/.867 slash line. The power continued forward into this season, but the contact rate decreased from 84% last year to 76.4% this season, but that drop is worth the power uptick if that’s the tradeoff and he has been pushed hard up levels this season - so I expect some rebound once he settles in at the higher levels. There are also good power angles here as he has a near 50% flyball rate that is not yet factored into the fScores. Briceno has put up a 114.3 max EV and had a ridiculous 107.5 90th percentile EV in 2024. Briceno finished with 42 extra base hits in exactly 100 games in 2025.","He’s big, strong, has a great eye and can make contact, which is why the Tigers are starting to move him away from catcher as this is a guy you want to focus on hitting. He’s playing a bit young for the level, but unfortunately is a max four category contributor as stolen bases are a complete non-factor in his game, which dumps him behind Bazzana even though he has a potential full grade upside in the power department.",29,50/60,55/60,55/65,30/30,Y
22,30,Rainiel Rodriguez,C,Cardinals,2028,Agustin Ramirez w/ more power and less speed,"Big time power potential with plus to plus, plus exit velocities for his age (105.1 90th percentile EV and 111.1 max EV) and a great, mature plate approach as well as crazy pull power (I saw him hit the second longest homer in Roger Dean of anyone I have seen there, including pro players). The hit tool tracks to be above average to plus, keeping in mind he’s still only 18-years-old and he continues to get better the longer he’s at the level. Rodriguez finished the year with 43 extra base hits in only 84 games.","Rodriguez has a sky high power ceiling at catcher / DH and is a little short to move off position to 1B. He’s a solid, but not fantastic defender at catcher with a good arm and may see some time in LF or 3B at some point just based on the Cardinals catching depth so there may be a Josh Donaldson-like move around the field. I have seen a lot of Rainiel Rodriguez in person and every time I see him the plate approach and contactability improve, so there’s no reason to think he won’t develop into a power hitting stud. The hit tool and plate approach launch his potential over many guys with way better proximity, but not enough to bump him ahead of Eldridge (who is already in the majors and has 7-8 inches of height on Rodriguez) or Briceno who is a similarly talented hitter with a bigger body and a more developed hit tool vs. the power / quality angle profile of Rodriguez.",40,50/60,60/65,55/70,40/35,Y
23,31,Ryan Waldschmidt,OF,Diamondbacks,Mid 2026,Righty Lars Nootbaar,"Big OF who can play in CF and has great plate skills with an above average hit tool to pair with a solid power and speed combo. He hits the crap out of the ball and had some of the highest exit velocities in the 2024 draft. Waldschmidt is a little overly passive for someone who has some insane tools statcast wise (ala Lars Nootbaar), but thankfully he has increased his in-zone aggressiveness since my last ranking of him, though he still is not as aggressive as I would like. The line drive rate is an insane 31.3% at AA as he also gets to optimal angles. Waldschmidt has plus power with a 109 mph 90th percentile EV and 112.5 max EV and finished 2025 with 49 extra base hits in 134 games.","I always love when guys walk more than they strikeout and Waldschmidt is a guy who can possibly do this through the minors. I expect Waldschmidt to debut at some point next year and if his development continues to a league average hit tool, combined with his natural athleticism and batting eye would make him a potential All Star level player. Rodriguez has a safer hit / power combo despite being younger than Waldschmidt and thus gets the edge in my rankings even though I don’t expect any speed out of him as he has a progressively elite hit / power combo.",31,45/50,65/65,55/65,55/60,Y
24,33,Joshua Baez,OF,Cardinals,Late 2026,Byron Buxton / Jo Adell mash up,"Baez is a big, toolsy OF the Cardinals drafted in the second round of the 2021 draft with a much improved hit tool from a 65% contact rate in 2024 to a 75.1% contact rate in 2025 with solid angles for power. Baez has mashed with a max EV of 114.4 in 2023 and in 2025 he has recorded another 114 EV bomb. He ran a 106.6 90th percentile EV in 2023 and we don’t have all the numbers for what he has done this year, but he has 30/30 type tools if he can put the hit tool together. The contact rates continued to improve throughout the season and was over 80% from August 1st onward as he finished the season with homers in three consecutive games. Baez finished the season with 46 extra base hits across 117 games.","Baez has had a roller coaster minor league career after a very strong 2022 season, but a rough 2023 and 2024 kind of made him fall off the prospect rankings table - until this season, where he is definitely back! He has no splits troubles and there’s a chance the hit tool could trend to above average based on the linear progress he made in 2025. Baez changed his stance to be more upright as the season progressed ala Byron Buxton and notched a .301/.401/.537 slash with 8 bombs in his final 150 PAs.",85,45/55,50/50,60/65,65/60,Y
25,34,Carter Jensen,C,Royals,Debuted,Bo Naylor mechanics w/ a bit of a Will Smith batted ball profile,"Jensen is a beast of an athlete for a catcher. The Royals are the masters at developing stud catchers it would seem - with the Cardinals. He has some solid pull power while also showing the ability to hit the ball the other way, which should keep him from getting shifted to death. Jensen notched a subpar 73.8% contact rate on the season, but a very good 86.4% Z-Contact and he makes good quality contact within the zone as evidenced by his 16.3% barrel rate and 107.3 90th percentile which has resulted in an insane 59.6% hard hit rate at AAA and an over 23% line drive rate, so while he has below average contactability, the quality of contact is excellent and boosts his overall hit tool. Jensen had 54 extra base hits in the majors and minors this last season in 131 games.","Jensen’s walk rates increased as he moved up levels, but unfortunately for aggression's sake his swing rates decreased in turn without much of a drop in K rates. Jensen hits the ball consistently hard and even in his major league small sample size was hitting the ball hard and hitting to optimal angles with new max EVs which push his power potential up to over plus. While Jensen has the proximity and has shown more consistent angles to Baez to date, Baez actually has better contact rates and has a big time edge in the speed category.",69,55/55,50/55,55/65,50/45,Y
26,36,Jett Williams,2B/SS/OF,Mets,Early 2026,"Jose Altuve build, Bryson Stott-like production","Plate skills and speed, the contact tool is still developing, but should ultimately be a good tool for Williams, as he has gotten the hit tool close to his pre-injury 2023 levels with an 80.1% contact rate. He has non-zero power and because he has a quick swing can get to a surprising number of extra base hits. He has a max 108.4 EV in a small sample size of statcast data this year and could run into a couple 20 homer seasons, but will likely live in the 15 homer range who can steal 30-40 bags. Jett had a phenomenal 58 extra base hits in 130 games in 2025.","Jett is an interesting player who should have some position flexibility and has a bit of a mighty mouse in him despite the smaller stature. If he can get to a league average hit tool, the advanced plate approach and speed will carry him to fantasy relevance, however he needs to improve efficiency on the basepaths in order to get a forever green light. There’s proximity here, but I’ll take Jensen’s banked attack angles and EVs to the speed and better plate skills of Williams.",43,45/50,60/60,45/55,60/60,Y
27,37,Bryce Rainer,SS,Tigers,Late 2027,Lefty Carson Williams mechanics with a better hit tool and plate skills,"Big lefty bat with a nice stroke that should lead to an average hit tool with very good line drive angles (11.1% barrel rate and 23% line drive rate, though he did hit the ball on the ground too much and has poor air pull rate, which could limit his power upside). He has already shown plus power at the plate with an elite 90th percentile EV of 107.9 and a max EV of 111.6 with some wheels to boot. He was also a pitcher and has a killer arm, so should be a prime defender as well. Sans injury, Rainer might have worked his way into the top 20 prospects by year’s end, so now is the time to buy before he has a ridiculous Spring Training and everyone remembers him. Rainer only played in 35 games this year, but finished with 10 extra base hits.","The eye is solid with a 21.7% chase rate and there are no split concerns as he’s actually hit lefties better than righties with a nice reverse split hitting .318/.462/.500 against lefties. Rainer has been completely overshadowed by Konnor Griffin, but he is a very good prospect in his own right and could be a nice dynasty value since he’s avoided all the hype of some other similarly successful prep prospects. His EVs are impressive and his ability to get to barrels, but he needs more consistency in his angles in order to optimize his offensive profile. Jett Williams gets the edge primarily only because of about a two year proximity gap.",35,40/50,50/60,55/65,50/55,Y
28,39,Kaelen Culpepper,SS,Twins,Mid 2026,Dansby Swanson,"Kaelen Culpepper is showing a very nice hit tool and plus plate approach this season with a little power and speed on the side as the Twins first rounder from last season. Culpepper is running an average contact rate at 76% and is running a reported 105.9 90th percentile EV with a 110.3 max EV on the season. Culpepper has a slight reverse split, however the approach and power doesn’t change much - so this may just be a coincidence. His ability to hit to angles is more or less below average at an average 10 degree LA, but he has hit to a near 50% groundball rate; though his flatter swing path should lead to more line drives and less ground balls as he continues to develop. Culpepper had only 39 extra base hits in 113 games, so the gap power does have some flaws, but I still like him as a proximity and very well rounded hitter.","Culpepper has gone from a solid potential starter to a near guaranteed major league regular who will have fantasy value as an above average across the board player in the mold of a Dansby Swanson (who was my comp at the beginning of the year and that has really carried forward). He’s a safe 15/20 bet with who will hit .230-.270 in the majors while he is in his 20s and unlike other Twins prospects, he has yet to have a major injury slow him down as of this writing… I just knocked on wood. Culpepper gets some points for proximity and for being well rounded, but some of the guys with more unique / elite tools get the edge for me this go around, for example, Bryce Rainer’s power potential.",34,45/50,55/60,55/55,60/55,Y
29,40,Josuar Gonzalez,SS,Giants,2029,"Wander Franco (I know, the name is as bad as Voldemort, but it’s true)","Switch hitting kid with a nice swing from both sides of the plate and plus power from both sides, already showing some loud power tools with a wood bat. He has some wheels as well and projects out as a very well rounded player as long as the hit tool continues to develop as he ages through the levels. The 78.9 Contact% is actually excellent compared to most of the DSL players and he walked more than he struck out, so you have to love the hit profile. The only exit velocities available are that he has a reported 104 90th percentile EV in the DSL this year, which is fantastic for his age. Josuar Gonzalez scorched 19 extra base hits in 52 games in 2025.","Gonzalez was widely seen as the top international signee from last year and has firmly established himself as a legit dude after the DSL season this year. It will be fun to track him next year, as he could be on a Made-esk track if the Giants place him in low A to start the season (though it should be noted the Giants have been relatively conservative in promoting their prospects outside of Bryce Eldridge). Gonzalez is raw as a DSL guy, but I think he ultimately has higher upside than Willits thanks to the power, providing a more well rounded profile with big time star potential. However Culpepper gets the edge with his proximity and sneaky 20/20 upside. Top 150 Rank: 116",,45/55,50/60,40/60,60/65,Y
30,41,Eli Willits,SS,Nationals,2028,Bigger Jimmy Rollins type,"Willits is best known at being a very well-rounded player and could be kind of a highschool JJ Wetherholt type (with less power) where he will just kind of be boringly good at every level. We basically have no EV data on Willits publicly available since 2024, so there’s no point to repeat those numbers. There’s not a ton of public data yet, so I’m going to get a lot on feel from the video we have available and small sample sizes. The contact in his debut is what really stands out.","Willits should be a very solid across the board player and will be on my rankings for the next 3-4 years or so as he makes his way levels, so hopefully in 2-3 years I’m not writing about prospect fatigue on him. His rank is based more on my gut feel and projecting off not a lot of video, rather than hard data and a ton of video / in-person looks. The good thing is, I should get to see him a decent amount next Spring Training. Willits likely has a bit more upside than Culpepper, but with limited data and Culpepper’s massive proximity edge, he gets the nod in the pecking order.",55,50/60,45/55,35/45,60/60,Y
31,42,Nate George,OF,Orioles,2028,Jackson Chourio light,"George was a high schooler drafted out of the 16th round who has been one of the bigger breakout guys this year. George has a potentially plus hit tool and demonstrated the ability to get to great angles at low A with a fantastic 31.3% line drive rate, that has not yet translated to high A. He has plus, plus speed, but he is not the greatest baserunner, having been caught stealing 25 times this year. I don’t have a full ticket of exit velocity data on George, but he has recorded a 108 max EV this year after recording a max 104 last year in high school. The biggest concern is the angles are geared toward doubles and gap power, rather than home run power. George had 28 extra base hits in 87 games this year, including 9 triples.","It should be noted George does have some reverse platoon issues hitting only .208/.328/.283 against lefties. George has a lot of potential and has demonstrated above average contactability and plate skills for his age, but needs to work on angles and his baserunning to maximize his skillset. He’s a high risk, high reward type based on his current profile, but he has extremely high upside thanks to a great hit tool in line with some of the top 2025 draftees like Willits.",113,50/60,45/55,30/45,55/70,Y
32,43,Dax Kilby,SS,Yankees,2028,Skinny Gunnar Henderson,"Kilby’s a lean, projectable kid who already hits the ball harder than you would think looking at him, notching some ridiculous EVs in his small sample size debut to go with having top five run times in the 2025 draft class for those who participated in the combine, showing off some good base running ability in his debut and has shown a better than expected hit tool in his debut making him one of my favorite players to target in FYPDs, despite achieving terrible angles. There’s room for a ton of projectability as he adds muscle to the frame and develops the hit tool for better attack angles.","Kilby might have an ultimately safer profile to George being a more efficient runner with higher power potential, but George has done it for a year in pro ball and has proven to have a solid to plus hit tool over the full course of a season, which gives him the edge - plus one year in a proximity boost. On the other side of the coin, I jumped Kilby over Ralphy based on the potential to be a five tool player while Ralphy as a corner guy does not have the speed component to his game, limiting his fantasy upside.",N/A,45/55,50/60,45/60,60/65,Y
33,44,Ralphy Velazquez,1B/OF,Guardians,Late 2026,Lefty Only Victor Martinez,"Great hit tool with power, plate skills and some speed - he had some bad luck in 2024 and performed extremely poorly in high A, but has had a major rebound this summer getting a promotion to AA where he finished the season on an absolute tear. The hit tool is tracking to be a solid above average. We don’t have 2025 statcast data, but last season Ralphy notched a max EV of 115 including a 105 90th percentile EV and 16% barrel rate showing he can get to optimal angles all under the age of 20. His second half slash between both levels was .325/.406/.581 with 10 bombs. Ralphy knocked a pretty ridiculous 59 extra base hits in 122 games in 2025.","Velazquez was the Guardians first round pick, so this isn’t coming out of nowhere, but he has been especially impressive in CPX and A ball in 2023 and after a rough 2024 has rebounded for a very nice 2025 season, improving his ability to limit strikeouts at a very manageable 14.3% K rate in the second half which boosted his total slash and ability to create damage. He’s moved off catcher permanently, which is probably for the better to get his bat into the lineup regularly. He projects as a very solid Top 150 Ranking: 83",,55/55,50/55,60/65,35/30,Y
34,45,Eduardo Tait,C,Twins,2027,A lefty version of the Contreras brothers,"Eduardo Tait has a nice lefty swing with some big power potential, especially for a catcher and made it to A ball in 2024 as a 17-years-old. Come for the super high EVs for his age and stay for the productively aggressive hit approach that results in a fair number of barrels. He did have a rough second half after being traded from the Phillies to the Twins, but he’s a catcher and we should remember he had to learn an entire new pitching staff and is responsible for a lot more than standard position players. A young catcher getting traded mid-season isn’t exactly easy, so we should provide some grace on his post trade numbers from 2025. Tait had an impressive 47 extra base hits in 112 games this year as an 18-year-old who reached A ball.","Tait has put up some incredibly impressive numbers for this age and I love the swing and power. He’s also good defensively as someone who got eyes on him at A ball this season, hanging in to catch Andrew Painter. There is a little bit of a split concern, as he is not good against lefties and as a lefty catcher it means he might have kind of a strong-side platoon thing going on once he’s in the majors, but catchers sit a couple days a week anyway, so maybe it doesn’t even really affect his total per season plate appearances compared to other starting catchers.",42,50/60,30/40,55/70,30/30,Y
35,46,Ethan Holliday,SS/3B,Rockies,2028,JD Drew in the infield,"Holliday is much bigger than his older brother Jackson Holliday by 4” height and another 30 pounds, thus he’s closer to his dad, Matt Holliday’s, bulk and has a closer toolset to his dad, but as a lefty infielder rather than righty outfielder. He likely has a higher power upside than his father (recording a 111 mph max EV already), but will hit for lower averages, as he’s running a very poor 57.4% contact rate through his first 78 PAs in pro ball. It’s funny people are freaking out about the hit tool already and I would be lying if I didn’t say the terrible contact rate is at least slightly concerning, but we are talking about a guy who has a crazy support system working out with his brother and dad all offseason. Let’s chill a bit on the pessimism.","Holliday has dropped to fifth in my FYPD rankings after the debut, so while again I preach patience with him, I’m also not going to sit on my laurels so while I have dropped him a little, I’ve seen some people dropping him out of the Top 100 and out of their top 10-15 in the FYPD rankings. Tait gets the edge to Holliday, because for guys who are the same age, Tait has done it at pro ball and has put up a stronger hit approach and louder EVs.",25,25/45,30/55,45/65,45/45,Y
36,48,Braden Montgomery,OF,White Sox,Late 2026,Bigger Jasson Dominguez with less speed,"Athletic, switch hitting power hitter. He has an arm as a former pitcher as well and a quick, short swing where he gets to the ball no matter where it’s thrown. Montgomery is a true switch hitter with no split to speak of, he’s a boss on both sides of the plate which is a boon this day in age, though he does appear to have a better eye from the left side of the plate. He explodes on the ball from the left side of the plate level with the zone and seems to have more of an upper cut on his swing from the right side. The contact rates have unfortunately dropped from average-ish at low A (74%) to a well below average (67%) at high A and AA, but he does have a high quality of contact with an over 23.5% line drive rate on the season that increased as he went up levels. Montgomery has recorded some elite power numbers with a 115 max EV and an above average 106.4 90th percentile EV. Braden Montgomery put up a very nice 50 extra base hits in 121 games in 2025.","Montgomery has a volatile range within each skillset.. Below average contact, above average quality of contact. Below average reach rate, above average walk rate. Slow acceleration (poor baserunning 67% SB rate), high top end speed. Montgomery has proven to be very streaky players over the course of the season and has some loud tools, especially the power that make him very interesting, but he’s still pretty raw and needs to refine his hit tool and approach otherwise he’s just a switch hitting Trent Grisham.",46,35/50,35/40,55/65,45/55,Y
37,49,JoJo Parker,SS/3B,Blue Jays,2028,Roman Anthony-esk light swing mechanics,"Parker has a good swing for staying back on the ball and has a toe tap with big time coil before he strides into the ball from the back of the box. As noted with some of the other high school guys, a lot of what I’m going on is a small amount of video, some limited sabermetrics and high school stats. He had a max EV earlier in the season of 99.3, but due to his consistent swing and good angles he has a mid 20s power upside.","Parker was one of my favorite players in the draft class and has a swing that portends to eventual pull power that should play up as scouts report he has good barrel presence. He hasn’t done anything yet in pro ball to move up my rankings, but upon re-evaluation of my FYPD ranks and where I like him vs. other FYPD guys, this is just where he should really end up in my rankings with more research done this off-season.

38,50,Michael Arroyo,2B,Mariners,Late 2026,More athletic Ronnie Belliard build with a good Jorge Polanco-ish profile.,"Short swinging stocky athlete with quick hands and a ton of power in his fire hydrant frame along with some speed. He has a good plate approach and above average contact tool, which led to the 2024 breakout that has now carried over to 2025. Arroyo has recorded up to a 109.7 max EV in 2025 and we don’t have barrel or launch angle data on him, but the 23.7% line drive rate, under 35% groundball rate and reports of consistent hard contact with doubles power lead us to the conclusion he’s a plus angles hitter with an above average hit tool. Arroyo has a 76.5% contact rate on the season and is a classic sum of the parts is greater than the whole type of guy when all his above average tools are working in coordination. Arroyo had 42 extra base hits in 121 games in 2025.","Arroyo is a really solid player who is consistently good at advanced levels for his age, but tools-wise he is practically tapped out for what we should physically be able to project. There’s always a chance some improved bat speed could boost his hit or power tool a ½ grade, but while he’s incredibly stable, he’s a high floor, lower ceiling guy. I like Arroyo more for points leagues at more of a top 40 prospect, but considering roto as well, there are guys like JoJo Parker who just have a higher hit and power ceiling from the latest draft class and proximity be damned, I’m going for the hit/power upside.",32,55/55,55/60,55/55,45/45,Y

Hope started the season hot, but finished with a cool .220/.345/.339 slash in the second half. The contact rate is way down to a lackluster 67.2%, but he’s still showing a good eye at the plate and reportedly has hit (when recorded) to a 90th percentile EV of 108.5 (keeping in mind we don’t have public EV data for him), but he did hit a 470 foot bomb in the Arizona Fall League and he gets good angles with a more than 25% line drive rate, though he has pulled the ball less this year which has hurt him a bit in the HR/FB totals. Hope knocked 45 extra base hits in 127 games in 2025.","Hope’s hit tool has regressed as the season has gone on, though he does have some sneaky speed and should hit for more power as the quality of contact itself is good when the ball hits wood. He needs to reign in the strikeouts and take more chances in-zone instead of accepting walks if he’s going to do the most damage he can in the lineup, otherwise he may be more of a solid #6 hitter type rather than a middle of the order guy.

He’s shown a really strong hit tool (82.8% contact rate and 85.6% Z-contact) and has some unrealized power in his small sample size at the minor league level (107 90th percentile EV and 110 max EV). The pull power from his college days and the ability to mash extra base hits regularly is tantalizing, but he needs to show some health and stay on the field to realize his potential. DeLauter brought in 34 extra base hits in 81 games over the last two seasons.","DeLauter just can’t stay healthy and that’s tanked his prospect profile a bit for me. Every time he’s healthy and I think I’m back in on him, he gets hurt again. If he could stay healthy he has a .270-.280 profile with 25 homerun upside plus a ton of doubles power. If he didn’t have the health issues, he would be up in the 30s of my prospect rankings, but I do still like him and the fact he was on the Guardians post-season roster means he should break camp as a starter in 2026.",60,55/60,65/65,55/60,40/40,Y

The plate skills are elite and help the below average hit tool play up a bit, but despite lower end contact the quality of contact is fantastic as he’s rocking a 12.8% barrel rate and 15 degree average launch angle on the year. The power is fantastic as he carries some ridiculous exit velocities for his age and his size portends to more power. He progressed as the season went on with a .326/.468/.659 slash with 11 bombs in the second half and over 72% contact rate with a greatly improved air-pull rate. Duno smashed a ridiculous 52 extra base hits in only 113 games.","Duno missed most of 2024 with injuries, but has bounced back in 2025 to be one of the most exciting catching prospects in baseball. He’s more athletic than he looks as such a big dude and is pretty solid behind the plate. He may move to DH or 1B duties at some point ala Salvador Perez to keep the power bat in the lineup, but he has enough defensive skill to stick at the position. Duno played in the Arizona Fall League and finished strong with a three homer game in the AFL playoffs.",86,40/45,55/60,55/70,40/30,Y

Sirota had a recorded max EV of 113 and a 90th percentile EV of only 102.6, but this was only in limited sample size - the line drive rate and extra base hit ability show there is a plus power tool as he notched 32 extra base hits in only 59 games; though I would like him to swing the bat more often.","Sirota is one of the top breakout prospects of 2025, but unfortunately missed the second half of the season. The baserunning did not match the speed this year, but there is more potential than what we have seen on the back of the baseball card. Sirota’s back of the baseball card numbers might be a bit deceiving as he’s one of the highest ranked whose age-to-level wRC+ score is actually under his wRC+ in these rankings. There’s a lot to like here if the hit tool can grade out to average and the baserunning develops better. I give Duno the edge to Sirota as he has a higher power ceiling and he’s had a ton of success at a younger age.",49,45/50,60/65,55/65,45/55,Y
43,64,Demetrio Crisantes,2B,Diamondbacks,2027,Mini Xander Bogaerts,"Crisantes has a greater than plus grade hit tool and advanced plate approach to go along with sneaky good power and above average base running skills. He’s a thinner dude right now, but his bat can play up for sneaky power that may end up leading to 20 homer power if he can trend closer to his career max EV (117.3 max EV in complex in 2023, but only a recorded 106.5 in a small sample size in 2025) with above an above average angles profile. The 90th percentile EVs he posted 2024 were 102.5. The hit tool will get him to the bigs and if the power develops, it will make him an All Star.","Crisantes had a great 2025 until he missed the majority of the season with a shoulder injury, but what that means for us in an offseason is this is the time to buy while the value is down. Crisantes has a nice well rounded profile built on a great hit & plate approach profile that could be capitalized if he can get anywhere near some of the EV numbers he’s put up in the past consistently. Cristanes brought in 12 extra base hits in only 34 games this year. Sirota has more power upside and has shown it in the OPS and extra base hit departments and thus gets the bump vs. Crisantes in my rankings, though Crisantes gets a bump over Montes with a much higher floor, while still having a fun power ceiling thanks to the EVs.",82,60/65,60/65,40/55,50/50,Y
44,65,Lazaro Montes,OF,Mariners,Early 2027,Shades of an OF Matt Olson,"Big strong kid with fantastic power from the left side and a solid eye. The power is up this year from last year, but he is also striking out quite a bit more as the hit tool seems to be getting worse from a contact standpoint (62.9%), while the angles are slightly above average (15% barrel rate in 2024). He hits the ball very hard with a reported 116 max EV and a 106.3 90th percentile EV this season and smashed 58 extra base hits in 131 games.","Montes killed it in low A last season and then struggled when he was first bumped up to high A, but he did finish the season strong. The strikeout rates have ticked up, the contact has ticked down and he has not been good against lefties though still better than Spencer Jones. Montes might be a bit safer than Jones because his plate approach is more sound and he’s probably good enough against lefties to not be a platoon bat, but the tradeoff is a year of proximity and 20-30 stolen bases per year. Though Jones has to get on base to begin with to steal bags and Montes has been playing under age to level so there’s a better chance of his hit tool evolving into a 40 - which gives him the slight edge.",48,30/40,35/45,60/70,35/30,Y
45,67,Jonny Farmelo,OF,Mariners,Late 2027,Charlie Blackmon,"Big long levered lefty with some big time power / speed potential with quick back speed. He tends to coil up as the pitch is coming in and unleashes to make some nice driving contact that I think will lead to a big doubles profile. The hit tool has been down this year from 80% in 2024 to 63.6% in 2025, but the slug has been up despite erratic playing time things to a series of injuries from a torn ACL which sapped his speed in 2025 to a rib cage injury which is obviously affecting his swing / rotation. Farmelo had a 103.2 90th percentile EV in 2024 as a 19-year-old and he has hit to excellent angles when healthy with 13 extra base hits in 29 games","Farmelo missed the second half of the season in 2024 after suffering a torn right ACL that required surgery and then missed a large part of 2025 with a couple more injuries. We haven’t seen the speed this year or the hit tool, but his previous outcomes have shown these skills exist. Farmelo has a higher upside than Spencer Jones who has longer term hit tool concerns and much worse split concerns and though Farmelo is on his way to being dubbed the next Chase DeLauter with repeating injury concerns, he’s young enough I’d still bet on his health over Jones’ hit tool.",57,35/55,40/60,50/55,55/65,Y
46,68,Justin Crawford,OF,Phillies,Early 2026,Carl Crawford w/ less power (Taller Juan Pierre perhaps?),"Speed, lightning speed like his dad. The hit tool is plus or better and the plate skills are improving. We may also get 10-15 homer power to go along with the rest of the tools, once he improves his ability to get to quality contact. Crawford has a plus hit tool that would be near double plus if he was able to make quality contact rather than just getting wood to ball. The crazy thing is his raw power is also not bad, but the angles are just terrible as he is not barreling balls (only 3.5%) and hitting the ball on the ground more than 55.8% of the time. Crawford finished the 2025 season with 34 extra base hits in 112 games, which is not bad considering the complete lack of air-pull.","Crawford has performed like a stud leadoff hitter at an advanced level for his age throughout his time in the minors. The lack of power in his profile will stop him from ever reaching the top level of prospects, but he’s projected as an effective source of speed and batting average for the future and could get into 15 homer power if he can translate his raw power into game power (needs to improve angles and get the ball off the ground). Crawford could be a .300 hitter thanks to the hit and speed combo and could also hit 10-15 homers with 40 steals if he has the right manager and right position in the lineup to run. He doesn’t have Farmelo’s power upside, but he does have health. On the other side, he comes ahead of Spencer Jones, because Craford is a much safer prospect for future batting average, runs and stolen base totals.",66,60/65,50/55,35/45,65/70,Y

Ewing,OF,Mets,2027,Better mini- Jake McCarthy,"Ewing is centerfielder with a quick, compact swing and runs an above average to potential plus hit tool with decent enough angles at a 7.4% barrel rate and 10 degree launch angle when he was at A ball and we have that data - this also resulted in 46.3% line drive rate, but that was only at the A ball level. While in A ball Ewing showed decent enough hard hit data, despite only mashing three homers on the year with a 108.7 Max EV, 103.6 90th percentile EV and a 90.6 average EV, which are all good enough to reach 15 homers, but he gets the ball in the air less than 30% of the time, so the angles are not great for power, though the 117 XBH+ is exciting.","Rodriguez has a more well rounded profile than Ewing and gets the edge in my rankings, while Ewing then gets the call over Wilken who is an extreme in the other direction of power vs. speed, but Ewing’s above average hit tool could develop into a plus hit tool and if he can fix some of the angles issues it will make him a more well rounded player.",108,55/60,55/60,40/45,70/70,Y
48,70,Emil Morales,SS/3B,Dodgers,2028,Fernando Tatis Jr. light,"Big, athletic shortstop with high end power potential and decent speed. He has the Fernando Tatis Jr. swing which has led to a similar batted ball profile (though beware of the high swinging strike rate as an average hit tool is likely the best case outcome with high 60s-low 70s contact rates). Morales has a reported 102.6 90th percentile EV and max 106.1 which are solid at his age and when you combine his projected growth as a big 6’ 3” kid with the optimal angles he gets (29.2% line drive rate at A ball) too there is a lot of power upside here (136 XBH+).","Morales’ hit tool and plate skills have both actually improved from complex to A ball. There’s a lot of potential here with Morales and skills-wise he has a higher upside than even some of the other players ahead of him, but due to lack of proximity and being in the Dodgers organization where it’s easy to get buried - this pushes him down a bit in my rankings. Even though I dropped him, the drop has more to do with some very exciting 2025 draftees and some closer proximity bumps than a lack of production on Morales’ part - though it should be noted the Dodgers are a tough organization for prospect hitters to crack.",68,40/50,40/50,40/65,50/50,Y
49,73,Spencer Jones,OF,Yankees,Early 2026,Joey Gallo w/ more speed,"He’s huge at 6’ 6” and has ridiculous power potential with decent speed to boot. He has a ton of sneaky speed to go along with the huge power potential, but the swing has some massive holes in it and has gotten progressively worse (73.2% contact rate in 2023, 61.6% in 2024 and 59.6% in 2025). The contact part of the hit tool is bad, but the quality of contact is good enough as he has a 17.6% barrel rate and 14 degree average launch angle on the season, which is the only reason I give him a potential 40 grade on the hit tool. Developing a consistent (even if below average) contactability is what he will live or die by in the majors, though the air pull is still far below average for a potential power hitting threat. Jones notched 59 extra base hits through 116 games in 2025, so there’s bound to be some electric production, even if volatile. The 150 XBH+ is literally maxed out with Jones - buy at your own risk, but there is stuff to like here if he can hit enough.","He has changed his stance a number of times this season which has led to major inconsistencies from week to week. At the end of the day, the stats look good, but it’s a weird journey to get there and it might not be fun in a weekly H2H league. He’s basically the living, breathing risk reward line for “go big or go home.” Something that may help Jones overall would be to be a strong-side platoon bat as he had a .268/.328/.555 slash against righties in the second half, but only a .171/.277/.244 slash against lefties. The tools are electric and he is bound to be the best player in baseball some weeks, but other weeks will be horrible to own.",53,30/35,30/30,65/75,60/60,Y
50,74,Hector Rodriguez,OF,Reds,Early 2026,Wilyer Abreu and Michael Harris II mash (as hitters),"Rodriguez has fire hydrant build as a 200 pound 5’11” player with a short, quick swing that leads to a plus hit tool though he misses a tad on his swings (lackluster 4.6% barrel rate still leading to a 24.9% line drive rate), though the 20.2% flyball rate is fairly poor. Rodriguez has a much improved plate approach this season and above average power (105.8 90th percentile EV and 112.7 max EV) and a potential 20/10, gap hitter profile that can really play up in Cincinnati. He’s good enough against lefties to avoid the strongside platoon risk many lefties face and managed 46 extra base hits in 135 games this season.","The biggest issue Rodriguez faces is a lack of barrels that leads to inconsistencies across his batted ball profile that diminishes would could be a 65 hit tool and a sure fire 55 grade power as the batted ball spread is all over the map, though he still tends to find the gaps and pile up a number of liners. Rodriguez profiles as a solid starter, but the upside is limited as he should be a .270/.340/.450, 20 homer, 10 steal guy - so in shallow leagues take Spencer Jones for the upside, but in points or deeper leagues I’d lean toward the safety of Rodriguez.",72,60/60,50/50,50/55,45/50,Y
51,75,Franklin Arias,SS,Red Sox,2028,Righty Luis Arraez with a tad more power potential and better glove,"Good plate skills with above average power, really quick bat speed and hands and great speed. He has an elite hit tool, one of the best in the minors with a 88.9 Contact% across three levels in 2025 as a 19-year-old. He’s also shown the ability to steal some bags (though he’s not good at it) and has non-zero power with the power actually improving as he moves up levels. The highest recorded max EV for Arias is only 105, but that was also back when he was at A ball and we had those readings, while he has an average-ish for his age 102.6 90th percentile EV. He has at least an average ability to get decent angles on the ball with a solid doubles profile, but has yet to translate that to home run power and only notched 36 extra base hits in 116 games that limits his upside, however he does have a surprisingly high 123 XBH+ so that shows some of the limited power is league relevant.","I learned my lesson with Jacob Wilson… don’t underestimate an advanced hit tool in young guys that could still add power or speed. I think there could be 10-15 homer upside for a guy who should be a consistent .280 plus hitter. The dude is going to hit, that’s for sure, but this toolset plays best for points leagues and is kind of mid in standard 12 team leagues. Rodriguez doesn’t have quite the hit tool that Arias does, but most of the time I’ll take .270 20/10 over .290 10/5 for fantasy baseball.",54,65/70,55/60,35/45,40/40,Y
52,76,Aroon Escobar,2B/3B,Phillies,2027,Jean Segura,"Escobar has a fire hydrant build at 5’ 10” and 180 pounds and with simple swing mechanics and a naturally laid back load that leads to an above average to plus hit tool with a solid plate approach and emerging power to pair with above average speed. I admittedly wasn’t the biggest fan of the profile this offseason due to the lack of extra base hits, but the power has appeared this year with a 104.7 90th percentile EV and exceptional 25.1% line drive rate which has brought about the extra base hits in 2025, including a great 110.8 max EV for a 20-year-old middle infielder, but needs to turn the raw power into game power with only 32 extra base hits in 120 games in 2025 with only a disappointing 93 XBH+.","Escobar is a solid to above average player who profiles as a good second baseman, who could jump to plus hit and power tools as he develops further that would boost him to more of a Ketel Marte light type of ability, because the EVs are great for his age. Escobar is kind of a Jack-of-all-Trades, but the fact he has a potential plus hit tool with above average power and is young for the level are all pluses and while he doesn’t have the carrying hit tool of an Arias, he’s a safer bet for all around fantasy production and if the power evolves from above average to plus, then we have a dude here.",84,50/60,50/50,50/55,55/50,Y
53,78,George Lombard Jr.,SS,Yankees,2027,Barry Larkin light,"Lombard has a plus plate approach with an average hit tool and solid, but not great angles, but some extreme athleticism that hasn’t had a chance to play up yet (outside of the speed) since he’s been advanced aggressively age-to-level in a Cole Young-esk way (158 wRC+). Lombard added some muscle to his 6’ 2” frame this offseason, but it hasn’t resulted in much of a power uptick as of yet. He’s a doubles guy right now (122 XBH+), but could grow into more power as he has reportedly hit the ball over 110 mph, though the highest max EV on record is 108.4 and his 90th percentile from 2024 when we had data was 102.4, but is likely higher post muscle spurt.","Lombard was mashing high A with a .329/.505/.488 line, but has struggled a bit since making the transition to AA as a 20-year-old to a still solid 111 wRC+. And 158 wRC+, as Lombard’s adjustments to AA and a hopeful increase in power production are key indicators for his future value moving forward. He hasn’t really put up the numbers you would like to see, but tools wise and under the hood he’s been impressive on an age to level basis. I give Lombard the edge over Lewis because the hit and plate approach is much more sound despite Lewis’ much stronger power potential.",45,40/50,50/60,40/55,65/60,Y

At 6’ 2” 195 lbs, he is one of the strongest players I’ve seen live - all lean muscle and insane upside if he can manage even average contact. He has a powerful lefty swing with great wheels, but the hit tool has some major holes that lead to poor contact and strikeout concerns, despite showing a great ability to get to line drives and get extra bases with a 114 XBH+. The quality of contact is great for a doubles profile, but not for a masher as he has a 31.6% line drive rate and only a 5.3 air-pull rate in his A ball sample size.","There’s a real risk that Tyson Lewis is just the next iteration of Carson Williams with a worse glove, but the power upside is much higher and the upside in his tools is enough we should give him room to improve the hit tool. Lewis is a player of extremes and unless he spends some serious offseason time on refining his contact, he is going to be a polarizing player the next few years ala Spencer Jones.",99,20/40,25/40,55/70,65/70,Y

He’s lean, but has a nice righty swing that could get to more power as he matures, as he does have a propensity to get out in front of the ball and is a quick break out of the box.","Hall is intriguing thanks to his speed profile, his pedigree and based upon some scouting friends that have a very high opinion of him. We don’t have much data and I have yet to see him in person, so this spot is almost a placeholder, but I trust my people that Hall is worth the hype and as long as he gets bumped to A ball this year I should get some eyes on him in the Florida State League.",N/A,40/50,40/45,45/50,70/80,Y
56,85,Carson Williams,SS,Rays,Debuted,Trevor Story outside of Coors w/ better defense and worse hit tool,"Power, speed, ability to take a walk --- all check, the only thing this kid is missing right now is the hit tool (which arguably is the most important). He has quick hands and changed his stance from a slight crouch to be more upright since last year, but those Ks need to go down for him to reach his potential as a 20/20 type with a good walk rate in the majors. He does have a high quality of contact which balances out the terrible general contact rates and manages a great number of extra base hits, rocking a 146 XBH+ with 48 extra base hits in the majors and minors this year.","The power and speed skills are both still intact and his ability to take a walk, but the contact rates have always been horrendous. The good news is he will get playing time because the defense is phenomenal and the power / speed will play. Williams has proximity on his side as well, since he is more or less a lock to be the starting shortstop for the Rays next season, but he needs to spend the year working on limiting strikeouts and improving the contact rates to at least be serviceable in fantasy leagues as a middle infield option.",59,30/35,35/40,60/60,60/60,Y
57,86,Theodore Gillen,OF,Rays,2028,"Smaller, more toolsy Parker Meadows","Gillen has great timing at the plate, nice load and really gets on pitches with a sweet and powerful lefty swing. He has a nice sized athletic build and should develop into a power / speed threat. He played SS in highschool, but with a weak arm has moved off to the OF. The hit tool is performing better than I had expected out of the gate with a 74.3% contact rate and near 25% line drive rate. The eye is plus with only an 8.8% SwStr%, while he’s shown but he has been a little too patient with only a 34.3% Swing%. He’s been getting to better angles this year with a plus air-pull rate, as he’s also lowered the groundball rate and increased the linedrive rate. I have not found publicly available max EVs since high school, but this year he has a reported 103.2 90th percentile EV, which is good for his age, but the 99 XBH+ portends to only average-ish power, but the speed is plus.","Gillen is a bit of a flier as a high school athlete in a system that can get crowded with Tampa, but there is a good power / speed skill set here that will play up in this system if he can develop the hit and power tools - as a lot of Rays guys have good power and speed and never develop the plus hit tool. His plate approach and angles will help the hit and power tool play up and he has been a burner on the basepaths this year despite rookie reports of only above average run times. The lack of power against lefties is a bit of a concern and ultimately Williams gets a slight edge based on proximity and the position.",61,40/50,60/65,40/55,60/60,Y
58,89,Bo Davidson,OF,Giants,Mid 2026,Curtis Granderson,"Davidson is a toolsy undrafted outfielder with a good plate approach from a lefty toe tap to lunge stance who is developing a solid hit tool as he advances levels. Davidson is slightly below average in contactability, but he carries excellent angles with a 27.5% line drive rate in 2025. He has above average speed and a potential plus power tool, having netted a 112 max EV, a very good 106 90th percentile EV last season and an elite 78.9 mph bat speed. The 146 XBH+ shows us that he’s a beast when it comes to damage creation with 41 extra base hits in 114 games, but in the leagues he played in he was near the top.","Davidson is one of the more under the radar breakout guys from 2025, though I suppose technically he broke out in 2024, but this is the “show me” season where he is proving last year wasn’t just a flash in the pan. Davidson had a rough final month of the season, but he was dragged down by a .239 BABIP over that timespan, so I’m not too concerned. Davidson profiles as a solid above average MLB regular that could develop into a 25/10 guy, but we all know San Francisco is rough on lefty hitters when it comes to power, which could limit him to 20/10.",123,45/55,50/55,55/60,55/55,Y

The power for Estrada is developing as he got to a 24.6 line drive rate and a fantastic 128 XBH+, though he needs to improve his air-pull rate to get to better power. He hits the ball harder than you would think for a small dude, getting to a 112 max EV earlier this year and reportedly hitting 102 90th percentile EVs in the 2024 season, which based on these numbers and the change in attack angles, he has a lot more power to grow into. He’s aggressive on the basepaths and also a pretty solid base runner.","I love Estrada’s swing, high hands, simple toe tap in the box and a nice load that gets him into way more power than you think he would be capable of and reminds me of a mini switch hitting Shohei Ohtani. I would like Estrada even more in a different organization, but he’s blocked on the Orioles by Holliday and Gunnar, so he needs a trade otherwise he will be stuck in the minors. Davidson has a better path to playing time and a better power profile, thus he gets the edge - though this could change if Estrada is traded.",110,50/60,45/50,45/55,65/60,Y

Like many of these guys, Rodriguez has to work on his hit tool a bit and cut down on the strikeouts. The batted ball profile is poor and he gets to terrible angles for a potential power hitter (only 8.9% air-pull rate) The power and speed potential is ridiculous, but he has not been able to get anywhere near his potential thanks to injuries, inconsistencies and strikeouts. He also needs to be more aggressive in order to maximize his hit, even with these issues he is still talented enough to do damage with a solid 124 XBH+.","He’s dealt with injuries the last couple of years, but has been good on a per plate appearance basis, despite too many strikeouts and a high three outcome potential. Rodriguez is a former top 10 prospect for me who has great potential if he can improve the hit tool and limit the strikeouts.

He has a crouched stance to a leg kick to get to his power, but it’s not the quickest set-up and while it will lead to power could affect the contactability. In his small sample size he showed only below average contact and average-ish angles and has had reported exit velocities over 110 mph with a wood bat, but no hard data as of yet since he’s on the west coast. Taylor did have plenty of power in his pro debut and notched a 117 XBH+, but could benefit from being more aggressive at the plate.","Taylor was a sneaky pick by the Athletics and this is an organization I trust in development. He’s already showing off the power in his small sample size in pro ball and once we get some more data, he could be a mover early next season up the rankings despite my noted concerns with the hit tool, the advanced plate approach could help him jump levels quickly and while I have him marked for a 2027 debut a late season 2026 debut wouldn’t surprise me. Despite a much better hit tool and approach than Emmanuel Rodriguez, I’m giving him the edge as he has a longer track record in the pros and at least a year better proximity.",127,35/50,45/60,55/60,50/50,Y

He has a plus hit tool with a solid doubles profile as far as angles (26.8% line drive rate & 111 XBH+ at A ball), but he’s not likely to get into power as the flyball rate is below average. He’s reported to have hit a 108 max EV in the DSL last year and this year has a 105.9 90th percentile EV, which is insane for his size and age - but the low A data is limited in the Carolina League.","The biggest concern about Caceres right now is how much power he will actually grow into, having played last year at the age of 17. He hits the ball hard frequently, but needs to get the ball into the air to maximize his profile. Taylor gets the not over Caceres, because he’s shown his power in college and in his short pro stint and being a college guy should move quickly through the minors.",93,55/60,50/60,45/55,40/45,Y

He’s young with a solid frame and brings a lot more power than you might expect for his age. He maxed out with a 107 EV last season with a 90th EV of 102.3 (solid for his age), but only had a recorded 105.7 in the limited statcast data we have available from high A. He got worse as the season went on in 2025 and had an absolutely terrible second half that was also partially some bad luck with a .235 BABIP weighing him down - on the bright side he had a 146 XBH+ in the second half with 22 extra base hits in his final 42 games (22 / 31 total hits went for extra bases).","In two seasons now since being drafted Nimmala had a good second half in 2024 and a good first couple of months in 2025, but has had a very rough time outside of that period, though as noted above some of this can be explained by bad luck. He needs to do a better job of choosing his pitches as this seems to be his biggest flaw at the moment as he has a tough time with breaking pitches, especially sliders.

We don’t have wood bat exit velocities for him, but based on his 113.9 metal bat max EV and 92-94 average EVs in college, we can assume he would likely have a 106-110 max EV and 87-91 mph average EV. Conrad notched an elite 92% Z-Contact rate in 2025 in college..","Conrad has not yet debuted in pro ball, so we only have college data, college video and some Cape Cod info to go off of, which is not a fair comparison to the other players within these rankings. Conrad has an above average to plus hit tool and is a smooth athlete who will play a solid outfield and is at least an above average player across all tool sets. He could be the Carson Benge type of 2026 who just zooms up levels with an advanced approach throughout all facets of the game. Mechanically, he reminds me of Wyatt Langford, but just hits from the other side of the plate.",N/A,50/60,45/55,45/55,55/60,Y
65,102,Ryan Clifford,1B/OF,Mets,Early 2026,Vinnie Pasquantino with more Ks,"This kid has big time power and a decent eye to take a walk. The hit tool has improved year-over-year and as he has gone up levels and could potentially grow to an above average tool. Clifford boasts great power angles with a plus air-pull rate, a plus barrel rate and plus launch angles in general, including line drive ability and maxes out with a 150 XBH+. The max EV is only 111, though I’m sure he’s hit it harder when we haven’t had the data based on his profile and his 90th percentile EV is sitting at a very good 107.4 mph. As long as he can limit strikeouts, there’s a chance he can slide right into Pete Alonso’s spot.","The power is legit at a young age, he might struggle at times with strikeouts, but he actually does have a good approach with only a 22.9% chase rate at AAA. He needs to swing in the zone more though, as a 60.4% Z-Swing% is way too passive. Clifford has hit 72 homers over the last three years at ages 19, 20 and 21. He’s going to grow into a potential 30 homer bat in the majors, potentially as soon as 2027. The lack of speed pushes him behind some other guys like Conrad due to being a four category guy, but in OPS or points leagues you may want to jump him up a bit - I think he will be an under the radar stud in those types of leagues.

66,106,Cooper Pratt,SS,Brewers,2027,Giant Ha-Seong Kim,"Pratt is a huge athletic SS that is far away as a high school guy, but has light five-tool potential, especially due to his size. He has a long, exaggerated leg kick in his swing that I’m not a fan of, but the longer levers have not been an issue on his ability to get to the ball with a 78.3% contact rate on the year and solid line drive angles (keep in mind he’s hitting in the Southern League this year, which is infamously difficult). The lack of power is a bit concerning as he’s only reached a reported 106.5 max EV and 100.7 90th percentile EV on the year. His speed is above average, rather than plus, but he has very good baserunning skills.","Pratt could grow into 20 homer power due to his size, but for now he works off a killer plate approach teamed with speed. Pratt has some excellent upside and some of the numbers should be taken with a grain of salt, as he’s hitting in a bad hitting environment and deserves a boost, but the lack of power still is starting to become concerning in regards to his ultimate upside. Pratt benefits from playing young for his level with an adjusted wRC+ of 151 and he does at least get to extra bases despite the lack of homerun power with a 114 XBH+ on the year.",97,45/50,60/65,40/45,60/55,Y

He gets to very good angles for a power hitter as well (15 degree average launch angle in 2025, 17 degrees in 2024 with an 11.5% barrel rate). The real juice is in the EVs and the ability to pull in the air. Valdez upped his max EV from 2024 112.5 to a reported 114 to this season and assuming a similar increase in his 90th percentile (105 in 2024), he’s a potential plus, plus power hitter. Valdez also has some wind behind his sales as he completely dominated the Arizona Fall League with a .368/.513/.842 slash line and 8 bombs across 80 plate appearances.","I’m usually a bit lower on the power first types without speed, but Valdez hits to such good angles and has put up very good exit velocities, he’s one of the safer power hitting types in the minors and could be a future 30 homer guy. The organization and park aren’t the best developmentally for his profile, but he had a strong finish to the year in the Arizona Fall League and is also a bit young for the age with a nice 152 wRC+ and a maxed out 150 XBH+ at AA this year as a 21-year-old. As long as Valdez can hover at a 40-45 hit tool, he can become a very usable fantasy first baseman. Pratt has a higher ceiling thanks to being more well rounded and gets an edge to Valdez now, but this is league dependent.",138,40/45,45/45,65/70,30/30,Y

The angles are a bit up on the air for Caissie, because his air-pull of 13.8% is sub par for power, while he’s hitting the ball on the ground too much at 38.9% of the time, but he still manages a plus 17.4% barrel rate and had a 150 XBH+.","Caissie has always played young for the level and I expect more power to develop based on the exit velocities, but the overall quality of contact to catch up in order for this to happen. These are the major hurdles that will determine whether or not Caissie leans toward good Cody Bellinger production or bad Joey Gallo production, while the EVs keep his prospect status afloat. A lot of people will have Caissie as a Top 100 guy, but he’s basically all power at this point with a lot of questions in the approach and hit tool - plus he can’t hit lefties, so he’s likely a platoon bat with a .217/.351/.359 slash against lefties on the year. Many will argue how I can have Spencer Jones so many spots above Caissie when they have similar splits concerns and Jones hits for much lower contact rates, but Jones actually is able to generate much better quality of contact when he does hit it and has good wheels that give him a bit a boost. The power upside with the angles in Jones is much higher, though I do expect better batting averages from Caissie.",118,40/50,35/45,55/60,35/40,Y

He has a potential plus hit tool for a catcher with a very solid plate approach and potential above average power which if he had regular playing time would result in a very good and consistent catcher who could put up .260-.280 with 15-20 homers seasons regularly.,"Quero is going to be a solid major league catcher for a long time, the fact he’s healthy now after a rough year and a half gets him back into my Top 150, though his best case scenario for playing time will be maybe 30-40% playing time in 2026 because he’s behind one of the better catchers in baseball on the depth chart. Longer-term Quero is very good defensively and probably moves Contreras off as the primary catcher to keep him healthy and get him more at bats as he ages. Valdez and his power stroke get the edge over Quero, but he’s a solid asset overall and should be re-considered.",N/A,55/60,55/55,45/55,35/35,Y

Sullivan finished with an incredibly rough second half slashing .191/.357/.264 after a fabulous first half, but overall he’s basically the Astros version of Emmanuel Rodriguez with a big time three true outcomes approach with plus speed. He hits the ball hard with a 112.2 max EV at the 2024 draft combine and a reported 108 90th percentile EV in 2025. The contact rates are only below average, but the angles are also below average and he doesn’t swing enough.","Sullivan might actually be the actuality of who Emmanuel Rodriguez was supposed to be. His approach and hit is a more standard and safe version of what Bolte is doing in the minors. Yes, Bolte has more natural athleticism, but the hit tool and angles are so bad - I just don’t think it’s sustainable over a long period of time, even if he does have some crazy hot stretches. Sullivan’s bad second half and lack of even a below average hit tool at this time keep him below a very solid Jefferson Quero despite the fact Quero will not get full-time ABs right away, as SUllivan also has some split concerns.",132,30/40,35/50,55/60,60/60,Y

The power is mostly coming from the left side of the plate and he needs to work on angles as the quality of contact that he has shown in A ball is poor. Level does have power potential if he can work on angles as he’s logged max exit velocities of 111.8 and 112 this year, which is potential above plus at his age, but the 88 XBH+ at low A is concerning.","Level has plus tools across the board and is getting into some very nice power for a kid who is barely 18-years-old with a 100.7 90th percentile exit velocity in the DSL as a 17-year-old. He’s oddly run some lower BABIPs in DSL and CPX, which the opposite is usually the case, but part of that is he has had some low line drive rates at both levels - so it will be interesting to see his barrel numbers once that data is available.

He smoked a 103.3 90th percentile EV last year as a 19-year-old which portends to a solid 50-55 power tool and a good pull rate, but he could still work on angles and squaring up the ball as he’s been hitting a lot of groundballs at AA (almost 50%).","Rojas is young for his age-to-level, which is a boost to his potential as he had a great season in high A before getting the jump to AA as only a 20-year-old and has a career high home run total already this year, so the power is developing. The Cubs have actually had some trouble as an organization finishing the development of some of their guys and I don’t necessarily trust them to get the most out of Rojas - but I like him as a very well rounded player that looks to me like a future starter, but I give Level the edge for higher power upside while Rojas gets the edge to Bolte as a much safer future big league regular.",94,50/55,55/60,40/50,55/50,Y

Troy has double plus speed with a much improved plate approach as well that could result in a 15/25 potential profile. He has a 5’9” fire hydrant type build with a big leg kick in his swing and the AAA data thus far doesn’t portend to much power with a 105.6 max EV on the year and poor 100.9 90th percentile EV, is well below average, but he had a 108 max EV last season","Troy has had an up and down minor league career since being drafted, but outside of the poor exit velocities in 2025 has improved his contact rate, improved his plate approach and has more speed potential if he decides to get more aggressive on the basepaths. He profiles as a very solid second baseman longer term for the Diamondbacks, which is what may be pushing Ketel Marte to being expendable.

He had a solid 77.9% contact rate through in his small sample size and it should be noted he had angles issues with a 47% groundball rate in college. Irish has put up a 112 max EV with the wood bat, so there is some plus power potential in the bat if he can put the ball in the air.","Irish has the potential to be a middle of the order bat, but likely more in the 5-6 hole of the lineup where maybe we could see something like a lefty Nick Castellanos production. Irish should be a solid player and fly through the minors as long as he can limit the strikeouts and start getting to better angles, but the 20 game debut we have seen thus far was not impressive and the angles were horrendous, which makes him more of a project than I originally suspected when he was first drafted out of college. Troy has a more sound hit and plate approach as of now and despite having poor EVs still finds a way to get to some power, while Irish has to fix his attack angles and has no pro track record of development to provide confidence in improvement.",88,40/55,40/50,45/60,40/40,Y

He’s an air-pull master with an incredibly high degree of quality contact and above average EVs that result in a sneaky high power potential. Ortiz also has a good ability to take a walk and should put up a decent OBP netting a very solid fScore profile. The strikeouts are a little bit high and we would like to see that downtrend to closer to 20%, but he’s a young 21 and still has room in his development. The 39 steals are super sneaky as a bigger dude with below average speed, but he was surprisingly efficient and might have a Josh Naylor-like ability to sneak some steals in the tank.","Ortiz is still underrated in fantasy circles and should be viewed as a big time breakout with real MLB starter potential. He’s really almost a clone of Isaac Paredes and hopefully can follow his route to the majors. Irish gets the edge to Ortiz simply because he has a higher pedigree from his draft position and his college track record, but they actually might have pretty similar statistical profiles even though Irish is a lefty OF and Ortiz is a righty IF.

He’s rumored to have reached up to 110 mph exit velocities in the DSL, but I feel like that’s the story for a lot of these guys and we don’t have solid data on it, but if that’s the truth of it with his quality angles he can get to a plus power tool.","Pena looks more like a second or third baseman more than a shortstop longer-term, but that’s not as important for fantasy this far out. Pena was the best hitter in the DSL this season and deserves to be the top DSL player on this list. We are getting into a tier of higher skill, lower proximity players and Pena leads that tier.

The Tigers paid Rodriguez a $3.2 million bonus, so they obviously like the potential, though I do have some concerns about the swing and miss longer term.","Pena has a better quality of contact, hit tool, plate approach and speed; while Rodriguez has the higher power outcome.

He swings bigger than his size and with a lackluster 81 XBH+ and 100.7 90th percentile EV, the power is not very sub par - but the max 109.2 EV shows there’s room for growth in this part of his game and while he profiles more like Chandler Simpson at this point, there’s potential for 10-15 homer power to become a reality.","Nori can be more efficient on the base paths and while he does often get to the sweet spot pretty nicely, the lack of consistent exit velocities limits his damage. The lack of exit velocities limits his upside, similar to Franklin Arias and while Arias has more power potential, Nori has a fine ability to jack a lot of stolen bases.

Arquette reportedly has posted a max EV of 104 with wood in the Cape Cod league last year and he ranked in the 92nd percentile of EVs in college last year - indicating an above average to potential plus power tool.

The extra base hits weren’t there for him in his pro ball debut in 2025 with only a 94 XBH+, but as a bigger dude who should get to more power as he matures there’s room for power growth.

Aloy should be a quick mover if he can control the K rate with an impressive 140 XBH+ plus a decent number of steals in this pro sample size of only 20 games.

This year he has only played at catcher and DH and though he might move off a bit, now that he’s changing organizations. The good news is he isn’t stuck behind Cal Raleigh, but he is stuck behind Keibert Ruiz and while it appears there will be a competition between the two for the starting job, it’s very possible they split time at catcher with Ford maybe getting the chance to play other positions if he is hitting.

It only helps that he’s a defensive whiz and he gets the edge to German based on much better proximity having already played a good amount in AA, but I couldn’t bump him above the power / speed potential of his teammate, Aidan Smith.",N/A,55/65,45/55,40/50,50/50,Y
87,142,Marconi German,SS,Nationals,2029,Jose Ramirez light,"German has been building onto his frame to get to more power as a mid-sized switch hitting middle infielder with an advanced plate approach, good power angles and a smooth all around approach reminiscent of the great Jose Ramirez. He’s reached up to a 107 max EV and notched a solid .230 ISO in the DSL this year that portends to above average power.","German doesn’t have the same elite tools as some of the other DSL prospects and international guys we have looked at prior to this point in the rankings, but he is very well rounded and doesn’t seem to have any major flaws in his game. It’s possible he could advance up rankings as an underrated jack-of-all-trades type ala Michael Arroyo and it might be best to get in on him now before others begin to notice.",N/A,35/55,40/60,40/55,60/55,Y
88,143,Kemp Alderman,OF,Marlins,Mid 2026,Righty Joc Pederson without the splits issues,"Alderman has plus power with a strong extra base hit profile with a 150 maxed XBH+ to go along with some ridiculous exit velocities from AAA in a smallish sample size as you can see above. The barrel rate and sweet spot percentage are impressive, while the air-pull is good enough. The hit tool is below average, as is the plate approach, but they aren’t bad enough to limit his power upside in the majors as he made major gains in this area of his game in 2025.","The stolen base totals are a bit of a mirage with Alderman as he’s a pretty bad base runner and the totals are all due to simple aggression that will be tempered once he gets to the majors. The power is real and he made nice gains in his hit tool in 2025, if he can continue to improve in the hit / plate approach side of the game even to below average 45s he will be a nice corner OF thanks to his power upside. I bumped Alderman ahead of Cunningham because of the proximity and he has way more power than Cunningham could hope to ever achieve, but German is such a well rounded player, even in the DSL I still would take German shares unless I was near competing.",N/A,35/40,40/40,60/65,40/40,Y
89,144,Kayson Cunningham,SS,Diamondbacks,2028,Bigger Sal Frelick as a SS,"Cunningham is a hit first, prep shortstop the D Backs selected in the first round of the 2025 draft. He has a smaller frame and did not have an impressive debut in pro ball, but it wasn’t bad. He notched a 102 mph exit velocity prior to the draft and did manage an impressive 79.3% contact rate. The quality of contact was lackluster though and the angles he was getting to were outright bad. He could develop into a 15/20 threat as he matures and had plus, plus run times pre-draft showing a quick burst that could lead to steals and beating grounders out of the box. He’s a quick twitch guy and has great bat speed, with a nice smooth, mechanically sound swing, but has a long way to go. The plate approach was too passive, he had way too many strikes looking and needs to get more aggressive to let the hit tool play up.","As a prep guy, he’s super raw and we don’t have a lot to go on outside of a little bit of video and reports that may or may not be biased toward the player, but I was a big fan of Cunningham going into the draft and the Diamondbacks have been successful at developing these types hit/speed guys into having more than expected power. German has more power upside than Cunningham and even if it’s only the DSL has shown more statistically, thus gets the ranking edge.",129,40/60,25/45,30/45,60/65,Y
90,145,Blake Mitchell,C,Royals,2027,Lefty Shea Langeliers,"Mitchell was the eighth overall pick in 2024. He was an absolute wrecking ball in A ball, but has some minor hit tool concerns with below average contact rates in 2024 and in 2025 and only average angles. He has some A grade power on scale with Cal Raleigh, but only from the left side as he jacked a 116.5 mph homer in the Arizona Fall League and a 93.2 average EV. He has a great plate approach and has the skill to run into 30 homer seasons, but will likely run lower batting averages. Interestingly, despite great speed he has been able to steal a decent number of bags in the minors, so it’s not a bottom tier speed grade as a catcher, but injuries heavily affected him in 2025.","Mitchell has enough speed that it might be beneficial for him to lift the ball a little less. The injuries put a damper on the progress he was making in 2024 until the Arizona Fall League where he showed off his ability to take a walk and get into some top notch power. He’s a former first rounder and has a ton of pedigree, but we need to see him start putting the tools together before he can get back into my Top 100. I still give him the nod over Ballesteros for fantasy though thanks to the power upside. Top 150 Ranking: N/A (97 in June prior to injury)",,30/40,40/50,60/60,40/40,Y
91,146,Moises Ballesteros,C,Cubs,Debuted,Lefty only Pablo Sandoval w/ more pop,"Ballesteros has a plus hit tool and power for a catcher, but he has a bad body ala Pablo Sandoval, which may negatively affect him down the line. While he’s great at making contact and has a solid approach, he struggles against lefties with a .234/.291/.285 and hits way too many balls on the ground for below average angles and a lackluster 7.9% air-pull rate. There’s a lot of Alejandro Kirk in here, but he is not as good defensively, so that dings him.","Ballesteros is a pure hitter with a ridiculous 179 adjusted wRC+, but the issue for Ballesteros is he does not have the height to play 1B nor the athleticism to play in the OF, so he’s basically stuck as a catcher / DH option only, which limits his offensive potential from a playing time perspective and the Cubs have some decent options this year at catcher. He also seems to be a strong-side platoon type with limited power upside based on the bad angles. He’s a high floor, low ceiling type and the hit tool is enough to nudge him ahead of some bad hit guys with fun power / speed upside you will see further back in the rankings ala Payne and Bolte.",92,60/60,50/55,40/55,25/20,Y
92,147,Termarr Johnson,2B,Pirates,Early 2027,"Short Jason Kipnis, might have some Dozier-esk or Brandon Phillips-esk seasons","There’s major prospect fatigue here with Termarr, but he still has tools that will get him to the big leagues. The hit tool is a tad underrated as he has a 75% contact rate, but he does not put together good angles for quality contact or for generating power - hitting too many balls on the ground. He has slightly above average speed, but he has not been a good baserunner this year, having been caught stealing 12 times. Johnson’s highest recorded exit velocity is 106.9 and he’s reportedly netted a 90th percentile EV over 105 which portends to average to slightly above average power once he’s fully developed, but he’s not there and the angles are so sub par that he only netted an 83 XBH+.","Johnson needs to develop more of a doubles profile to really make it. He’s still netting a 158 age adjusted wRC+ at AA as a 21-year-old, so he has been playing above his age-to-level and I think the Pirates bringing Brandon Lowe in busy a year of development for Termarr Johnson to focus on maximizing his outcomes, because the potential for an above average regular second baseman with fantasy relevancy is still there, which is why he keeps hovering around the back end of my Top 150 lists.",150,40/45,50/60,40/55,50/50,Y
93,148,Kala'i Rosario,OF,Twins,Late 2026,Hawaiian Austin Hays,"Rosario is kind of unassumingly athletic based on the simplicity of his hitting mechanics, but he broke out in a major way in 2025 with a 25 homer and 32 steal season, including posting 60 extra base hits in 130 games for a 150 XBH+. The major improvement this season came from a drastic change to his angles going from a groundball hitter to a pull, line drive approach that led to his extra base hit barrage. We don’t have a ton of exit velocity data from him, but we do have a 113 max EV this year and he was top of his high school class in exit velocities back in 2020 when he was originally drafted.","I’m not sure how real the 30+ stolen base quantity is, because he’s only an average runner footspeed wise, but he is a good baserunner and is aggressive when he gets on. I think Rosario profiles as a future 20 homer, big time doubles starting outfielder who will hit in the .230-.260 range almost like some peak Eddie Rosario seasons, but he needs to limit the strikeouts in order to get to those types of years.",N/A,40/45,50/50,55/60,55/50,Y
94,149,Braylon Payne,OF,Brewers,2028,Lawrence Butler,"Payne is a big bodied outfielder who is tooled up with a killer power and speed combo from the left side. He’s one of the faster guys picked in the 2024 draft and if he can develop the hit tools and classic Brewers plate skills, the tools can really play this kid up with some of the better Brewers prospects. Payne’s hit tool has regressed both contact and angles-wise from last year’s small sample size, but the plate skills are potentially above average to plus. Payne had a 110.2 max EV last season at 18-years-old and could grow into plus power if he improves his angles. He’s electric, speed-wise but could work on his base running ability. Payne was terrible in the second half with a .188/.307/.271 slash line after a very nice first half.","Welsh turned me onto Payne after he saw him in the Bridge league and told me Payne was absolutely electric. He’s super young, getting some solid reps at A ball last year while the other high school guys didn’t debut. I might have jumped him a little too high early in the season after a fast start, but the hit tool also didn’t develop as I had hoped last year when he ran a 74% contact rate in the small sample size. He and Henry Bolte are very similar where they make the list here all based on their power and speed potential, but both need to develop at least below average hit in order to be relevant for fantasy purposes. Payne has a higher likelihood of hitting thanks to a better plate approach and slightly better contact and thus gets the edge to Bolte.",133,25/40,40/55,40/55,70/70,Y
95,150,Henry Bolte,OF,Athletics,2026,Lane Thomas & Righty Charlie Blackmon mash,"Bolte put up a decent steals total and some solid power numbers last year, but a high BABIP and high K rate made him look like a small ball version of Nolan Jones. Bolte has a bad hit tool and strikes out way too much, but he can take a walk and due to his speed is really good at nabbing extra bases when he does make contact with a 150 XBH+. His high batting averages are all based on his speed and BABIP luck, rather than his hit tool or approach ala Billy Hamilton. The interesting thing is he hits the ball hard and can run into barrels despite terrible angles and bad contact.","This dude has a terrible hit tool, but the power and speed especially at age-to-level are so enticing it makes him a fun upside gamble this late in the rankings. If he can develop even a below average hit tool by improving contact and angles and limit the strikeouts, he could be a fantasy unicorn - but I don’t find it likely, we are probably looking at Esteury Ruiz 2.0 and it may be lucky he hits the ball on the ground so much, because hitting the ball in the air was the undoing of Ruiz. Bolte has an extremely volatile player, but he is still young and has enough proximity that he should be noted as a potential stolen base wizard.",140,30/35,35/40,35/50,75/75,Y
