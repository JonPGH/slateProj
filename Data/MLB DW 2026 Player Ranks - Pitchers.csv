0,1,Paul Skenes,PIT,"A clear top 3 SP. The only problem is the lack of wins, which makes a big difference in standard roto value. But he's the best ERA pitcher in the game, we can't complain too much.",
1,2,Joe Ryan,MIN,"Did everything we thought he would last year. The HR issue keeps the ERA above three, which limits the ceiling a little bit, but the WHIP and strikeouts and stability are great. Strong SP2 option for 2026.",
2,3,Bubba Chandler,PIT,"Elite fastball, elite walk rate in his short time in the Majors. Great durability (so far), good GB%. The sky is the limit, and we have to consider the SP1 upside he has when ranking him. ",
3,4,Pablo Lopez,MIN,"K-BB% dropped to 17%, he's lost K% for two straight years now. HR issues, not great vs. LHB, getting older. Was very lucky to post a strong ERA last year. Lots of arrows pointing down here, but I think he's a fine SP3-SP4 option.",
4,5,MacKenzie Gore,WSH,"Maybe he'll never put it all together. Consistency has been a huge issue. But he showed the ceiling in April-May of last year and holds onto a high career K%. I think there's some hope, and I imagine he'll be pretty cheap in 2026.",
5,6,Shane Smith,CWS,"Very strong fastball + changeup foundation. Was impressive in his first year as a full-time starter after being a Rule V pick. Needs to lower the BB% a touch, but it's a solid profile. High upside arm.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/shane-smith
6,7,Zebby Matthews,MIN,"The K% and BB% are there, he just keeps giving up a ton of tanks. I'd rather buy than sell on the guy, but he doesn't seem like a guy who will put up a great-looking ERA until he tames down the FB% a bit.",
7,8,Cade Cavalli,WSH,His SwStr% + Ball% + GB% trio were elite. Great fastball and curveball with a sinker/change behind it. Was very unlucky last year. Health pointing upward. Breakout season is coming.,
8,9,Simeon Woods Richardson,MIN,He introduced a new splitter and dominated late in the year when he started using it more. Pretty enticing guy for 2026 at the cost. But that's putting most of your chips on the splitter truly being a difference-maker.,
9,10,Mike Burrows,PIT,"Had some success in the Majors, stayed healthy and threw 130 innings. Elite changeup with some potential in the fastball. Needs to improve with the heater, but if he does, he could be quite effective.",
10,11,Bailey Ober,MIN,"His HR issues and low K% really limit his fantasy ceiling even if he does bounce back to 2023-2024 form. And we saw how bad it can go with him in 2025. I don't see much reason to draft him, but it's reasonable to think you can get a 125 strikeout season with a 1.10 WHIP next year if he's healthy. ",
11,12,Sean Burke,CWS,"Finished strong with the K%, but was hurt a lot, and he's never thrown enough strikes. There's non-zero upside with him at his age with the fastball he has, but overall it's a thumbs-down.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/sean-burke
12,13,Mitch Keller,PIT,"Known commodity at this point. Good for QS, but not great at anything and mostly a negativ over a full season. Reserve for super deep leagues and streaming.",
13,14,Hunter Barco,PIT,"Not a lock for the rotation by any means, but is the only considerable lefty they have. Pretty nasty left-handed sinker with a split and slider. High upside arm, I'd say. But hard to draft while we don't know where he'll pitch. ",
14,15,Braxton Ashcraft,PIT,"Need clarity on what the Pirates do with their rotation, but Ashcraft could be a pretty solid arm for them. Maybe not a great fantasy option with a lower K%, but he's interesting.",
15,16,Chase Dollander,COL,"Super deep points leagues, there still has to be some hope that he can become a 150-strikeout guy? Maybe?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/chase-dollander
16,17,Jared Jones,PIT,"Exciting arm, could have a very good career. But returning from TJ this year makes you doubt the volume and even some of the early performance. Decent IL stash to start the year.",
17,18,Josiah Gray,WSH,He'll need to be way better than he ever has after recovering from TJ at age 28. I don't think that'll happen!,
18,19,Brad Lord,WSH,"Will probably be in the rotation, but he's not good. Single-digit SwStr% with a home run problem. ",
