0,1,Paul Skenes,PIT,"A clear top 3 SP. The only problem is the lack of wins, which makes a big difference in standard roto value. But he's the best ERA pitcher in the game, we can't complain too much.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/paul-skenes
1,2,Joe Ryan,MIN,"Did everything we thought he would last year. The HR issue keeps the ERA above three, which limits the ceiling a little bit, but the WHIP and strikeouts and stability are great. Strong SP2 option for 2026.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/joe-ryan
2,3,Chris Sale,ATL,"He hasn't given us any reason to doubt the skills, but he'll be 37 and did not stay healthy last year. It's a risky pick, but you can't let him slide very far down the list. He's a top ten arm in the league when healthy.",
3,4,Spencer Schwellenbach,ATL,"Broken elbow last year, but at least it wasn't a ligament thing, and he probably would have returned if the Braves were in contention. Great numbers across the board, high-floor, high-ceiling pitcher.",
4,5,Kyle Bradish,BAL,"Awesome numbers from 2024-2025 before and after the surgery. Looked great in late 2025 after returning, finished healthy. I have some questions about the fastball and his durability though. ",
5,6,Bubba Chandler,PIT,"Elite fastball, elite walk rate in his short time in the Majors. Great durability (so far), good GB%. The sky is the limit, and we have to consider the SP1 upside he has when ranking him. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/bubba-chandler
6,7,Spencer Strider,ATL,"If he doesn't get the velo and command back, I don't know if he can be very good. 2025 was pretty discouraging. The bet would be on him needing this offseason of recovery and returning in 2026 much closer to his 2023-2024 form. But I don't know if we ever get that Strider again.",
7,8,Pablo Lopez,MIN,"K-BB% dropped to 17%, he's lost K% for two straight years now. HR issues, not great vs. LHB, getting older. Was very lucky to post a strong ERA last year. Lots of arrows pointing down here, but I think he's a fine SP3-SP4 option.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/pablo-lopez
8,9,Trevor Rogers,BAL,"He was very ""lucky"" in 2025, but a lot of that shouldn't be shocking. Career 9% HR/FB, great fastball and changeup, great command. Overperformance in 2025 aside, he's a solid arm in a good park.",
9,10,MacKenzie Gore,WSH,"Maybe he'll never put it all together. Consistency has been a huge issue. But he showed the ceiling in April-May of last year and holds onto a high career K%. I think there's some hope, and I imagine he'll be pretty cheap in 2026.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/mackenzie-gore
10,11,Shane Smith,CWS,"Very strong fastball + changeup foundation. Was impressive in his first year as a full-time starter after being a Rule V pick. Needs to lower the BB% a touch, but it's a solid profile. High upside arm.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/shane-smith
11,12,Zebby Matthews,MIN,"The K% and BB% are there, he just keeps giving up a ton of tanks. I'd rather buy than sell on the guy, but he doesn't seem like a guy who will put up a great-looking ERA until he tames down the FB% a bit.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/zebby-matthews
12,13,Cade Cavalli,WSH,His SwStr% + Ball% + GB% trio were elite. Great fastball and curveball with a sinker/change behind it. Was very unlucky last year. Health pointing upward. Breakout season is coming.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/cade-cavalli
13,14,Simeon Woods Richardson,MIN,He introduced a new splitter and dominated late in the year when he started using it more. Pretty enticing guy for 2026 at the cost. But that's putting most of your chips on the splitter truly being a difference-maker.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/simeon-woods-richardson
14,15,Mike Burrows,PIT,"Had some success in the Majors, stayed healthy and threw 130 innings. Elite changeup with some potential in the fastball. Needs to improve with the heater, but if he does, he could be quite effective.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/mike-burrows
15,16,Bailey Ober,MIN,"His HR issues and low K% really limit his fantasy ceiling even if he does bounce back to 2023-2024 form. And we saw how bad it can go with him in 2025. I don't see much reason to draft him, but it's reasonable to think you can get a 125 strikeout season with a 1.10 WHIP next year if he's healthy. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/bailey-ober
16,17,Sean Burke,CWS,"Finished strong with the K%, but was hurt a lot, and he's never thrown enough strikes. There's non-zero upside with him at his age with the fastball he has, but overall it's a thumbs-down.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/sean-burke
17,18,Yusei Kikuchi,LAA,"Projections will like him to bounce-back a little bit, but he's a middling pitcher at best. I'd rather shoot for upside late in the draft than take a guy who we're pretty sure will be an ERA drain.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/yusei-kikuchi
18,19,Hurston Waldrep,ATL,"Way too reliant on the splitter. His fastballs are terrible, and he's had bad command his entire career. No thanks!",
19,20,Mitch Keller,PIT,"Known commodity at this point. Good for QS, but not great at anything and mostly a negativ over a full season. Reserve for super deep leagues and streaming.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/mitch-keller
20,21,Braxton Ashcraft,PIT,"Need clarity on what the Pirates do with their rotation, but Ashcraft could be a pretty solid arm for them. Maybe not a great fantasy option with a lower K%, but he's interesting. Love the SwStr% and GB% combo.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/braxton-ashcraft
21,22,Jacob Lopez,ATH,"Had a good K% and BB% last year, but it seemed a little bit lucky with a low SwStr%. He's also a heavy FB% guy, which is very bad vs. RHB in that home park.",
22,23,Hunter Barco,PIT,"Not a lock for the rotation by any means, but is the only considerable lefty they have. Pretty nasty left-handed sinker with a split and slider. High upside arm, I'd say. But hard to draft while we don't know where he'll pitch. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/hunter-barco
23,24,Jose Soriano,LAA,"Bad ratios are guaranteed! But he does not allow homers with his 66% GB%. Points league option, maybe? But he's bad.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jose-soriano
24,25,Chase Dollander,COL,"Super deep points leagues, there still has to be some hope that he can become a 150-strikeout guy? Maybe?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/chase-dollander
25,26,Jared Jones,PIT,"Exciting arm, could have a very good career. But returning from TJ this year makes you doubt the volume and even some of the early performance. Decent IL stash to start the year.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/jared-jones
26,27,Grayson Rodriguez,LAA,"IL stash only. Could go to the bullpen, starting to seem like a longshot that he'll ever throw 100+ innings again.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/grayson-rodriguez
27,28,Mick Abel,MIN,"Has some potential with the good fastball, but he needs to figure out how to not get hit so hard. History of bad walk rates and middling K%, I don't think there's much hope for him, but the change in scenery maybe makes a difference?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/mick-abel
28,29,Luis Morales,ATH,"Good velo, but bad results. Not a deep pitch mix. Feels more like a reliever to me. But the heavy fastball and lack of option options in the org gives me a sliver of hope.",
29,30,Jeffrey Springs,ATH,"Horrible fastball, 33 years old, and the park doesn't fit his style. The changeup keeps him in some games, but it's a very thin fantasy profile.",
30,31,Jack Perkins,ATH,This could be a moot point if he ends up as a middle reliever. But he can get a bunch of whiffs. Maybe even turns into the closer?,
31,32,Josiah Gray,WSH,He'll need to be way better than he ever has after recovering from TJ at age 28. I don't think that'll happen!,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/josiah-gray
32,33,Brad Lord,WSH,"Will probably be in the rotation, but he's not good. Single-digit SwStr% with a home run problem. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/brad-lord
33,34,J.T. Ginn,ATH,"Somewhat interesting sinker, but the ratios will be bad, and he's not at all guaranteed a spot.",
34,35,Luis Severino,ATH,"8.6% SwStr%, has nothing other than a [mediocre] four-seamer",
