0,1,Paul Skenes,PIT,"A clear top 3 SP. The only problem is the lack of wins, which makes a big difference in standard roto value. But he's the best ERA pitcher in the game, we can't complain too much.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/paul-skenes
1,2,Hunter Greene,CIN,,
2,3,Cole Ragans,KC,"No questions about his dominance, just needs to stay healthy",
3,4,Chris Sale,ATL,"He hasn't given us any reason to doubt the skills, but he'll be 37 and did not stay healthy last year. It's a risky pick, but you can't let him slide very far down the list. He's a top ten arm in the league when healthy.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/chris-sale
4,5,Jacob deGrom,TEX,"Did not pitch quite like a Cy Young, and you still have to worry about the injuries, but he's in a good spot to log another 27+ starts",
5,6,Spencer Schwellenbach,ATL,"Broken elbow last year, but at least it wasn't a ligament thing, and he probably would have returned if the Braves were in contention. Great numbers across the board, high-floor, high-ceiling pitcher.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/spencer-schwellenbach
6,7,Joe Ryan,MIN,"Did everything we thought he would last year. The HR issue keeps the ERA above three, which limits the ceiling a little bit, but the WHIP and strikeouts and stability are great. Strong SP2 option for 2026.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/joe-ryan
7,8,Chase Burns,CIN,,
8,9,Eury Perez,MIA,"Slight concern about innings (150?) and homers (1.3 HR/9), but the strikeouts and WHIP will be elite. Per-start SP1 upside for sure.",
9,10,Kyle Bradish,BAL,"Awesome numbers from 2024-2025 before and after the surgery. Looked great in late 2025 after returning, finished healthy. I have some questions about the fastball and his durability though. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/kyle-bradish
10,11,Logan Webb,SF,"Volume monster, very solid pitcher. I suspect the K% will drop back down to 22%, and the ratios are usually nothing special. He's very league-specific. ",
11,12,Bubba Chandler,PIT,"Elite fastball, elite walk rate in his short time in the Majors. Great durability (so far), good GB%. The sky is the limit, and we have to consider the SP1 upside he has when ranking him. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/bubba-chandler
12,13,Spencer Strider,ATL,"If he doesn't get the velo and command back, I don't know if he can be very good. 2025 was pretty discouraging. The bet would be on him needing this offseason of recovery and returning in 2026 much closer to his 2023-2024 form. But I don't know if we ever get that Strider again.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/spencer-strider
13,14,Ryan Pepiot,TB,"Going back to the Trop will work wonders for Pepiot. Ceiling is limited by a lack of a great secondary pitch, but I think the floor is fantastic. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/carson-williams
14,15,Pablo Lopez,MIN,"K-BB% dropped to 17%, he's lost K% for two straight years now. HR issues, not great vs. LHB, getting older. Was very lucky to post a strong ERA last year. Lots of arrows pointing down here, but I think he's a fine SP3-SP4 option.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/pablo-lopez
15,16,Trevor Rogers,BAL,"He was very ""lucky"" in 2025, but a lot of that shouldn't be shocking. Career 9% HR/FB, great fastball and changeup, great command. Overperformance in 2025 aside, he's a solid arm in a good park.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/trevor-rogers
16,17,Drew Rasmussen,TB,"Relies on soft contact and doesn't have a great breaking ball, but pinpoint command with high efficiency. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/drew-rasmussen
17,18,MacKenzie Gore,WSH,"Maybe he'll never put it all together. Consistency has been a huge issue. But he showed the ceiling in April-May of last year and holds onto a high career K%. I think there's some hope, and I imagine he'll be pretty cheap in 2026.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/mackenzie-gore
18,19,Kris Bubic,KC,"It's really just a question of health. Lots of injuries the last few years and finished the year hurt. Non-dominant stuff, but he's a good pitcher",
19,20,Nick Lodolo,CIN,,
20,21,Sandy Alcantara,MIA,"Bad luck and rust crushed his first half, but he was his normal self again over the last 15 starts. Solid value this year, but no true upside any longer at age 30 with a proven mediocre K%.",
21,22,Shane Smith,CWS,"Very strong fastball + changeup foundation. Was impressive in his first year as a full-time starter after being a Rule V pick. Needs to lower the BB% a touch, but it's a solid profile. High upside arm.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/shane-smith
22,23,Zebby Matthews,MIN,"The K% and BB% are there, he just keeps giving up a ton of tanks. I'd rather buy than sell on the guy, but he doesn't seem like a guy who will put up a great-looking ERA until he tames down the FB% a bit.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/zebby-matthews
23,24,Ryne Nelson,ARI,"Great fastball, but very high usage on it. Not a great putaway pitch. Solid floor pitcher though with that great heater.",
24,25,Nathan Eovaldi,TEX,"Good pitcher, no doubt, but a ticking time bomb with the age and all of these injuries from 2025",
25,26,Shane Baz,TB,"Was crushed by a 2.0 HR/9 at home last year. Park shift will help. Good fastball, deep arsenal. I think he's a solid floor arm with a little bit of upside if the K% can tick up a bit more with the velo.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/shane-baz
26,27,Cade Cavalli,WSH,His SwStr% + Ball% + GB% trio were elite. Great fastball and curveball with a sinker/change behind it. Was very unlucky last year. Health pointing upward. Breakout season is coming.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/cade-cavalli
27,28,Andrew Abbott,CIN,,
28,29,Jack Leiter,TEX,"Big fastball, bad command. Plenty of upside if he can refine himself a bit, and he went above 150 innings last year. Some reasons for optimism.",
29,30,Simeon Woods Richardson,MIN,He introduced a new splitter and dominated late in the year when he started using it more. Pretty enticing guy for 2026 at the cost. But that's putting most of your chips on the splitter truly being a difference-maker.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/simeon-woods-richardson
30,31,Mike Burrows,PIT,"Had some success in the Majors, stayed healthy and threw 130 innings. Elite changeup with some potential in the fastball. Needs to improve with the heater, but if he does, he could be quite effective.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/mike-burrows
31,32,Bailey Ober,MIN,"His HR issues and low K% really limit his fantasy ceiling even if he does bounce back to 2023-2024 form. And we saw how bad it can go with him in 2025. I don't see much reason to draft him, but it's reasonable to think you can get a 125 strikeout season with a 1.10 WHIP next year if he's healthy. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/bailey-ober
32,33,Sean Burke,CWS,"Finished strong with the K%, but was hurt a lot, and he's never thrown enough strikes. There's non-zero upside with him at his age with the fastball he has, but overall it's a thumbs-down.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/sean-burke
33,34,Yusei Kikuchi,LAA,"Projections will like him to bounce-back a little bit, but he's a middling pitcher at best. I'd rather shoot for upside late in the draft than take a guy who we're pretty sure will be an ERA drain.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/yusei-kikuchi
34,35,Hurston Waldrep,ATL,"Way too reliant on the splitter. His fastballs are terrible, and he's had bad command his entire career. No thanks!",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/hurston-waldrep
35,36,Noah Cameron,KC,"Fastballs stinks, low velo. But deep pitch mix and non-awful command. Could turn into a solid innings-eater, and it's a good park for him",
36,37,Mitch Keller,PIT,"Known commodity at this point. Good for QS, but not great at anything and mostly a negativ over a full season. Reserve for super deep leagues and streaming.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/mitch-keller
37,38,Braxton Ashcraft,PIT,"Need clarity on what the Pirates do with their rotation, but Ashcraft could be a pretty solid arm for them. Maybe not a great fantasy option with a lower K%, but he's interesting. Love the SwStr% and GB% combo.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/braxton-ashcraft
38,39,Edward Cabrera,MIA,"Cut five points off the BB%, but threw changeups and curves 50% of the time. His sinker was awful. I predict that BB% will be 10% again and he'll go back to mostly his old ways. Fade!",
39,40,Robby Snelling,MIA,"Questions about when he'll be up and how he'll transition, but he's ready for the MLB and the numbers last year were elite!",
40,41,Jacob Lopez,ATH,"Had a good K% and BB% last year, but it seemed a little bit lucky with a low SwStr%. He's also a heavy FB% guy, which is very bad vs. RHB in that home park.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/jacob-lopez
41,42,Hunter Barco,PIT,"Not a lock for the rotation by any means, but is the only considerable lefty they have. Pretty nasty left-handed sinker with a split and slider. High upside arm, I'd say. But hard to draft while we don't know where he'll pitch. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/hunter-barco
42,43,Jose Soriano,LAA,"Bad ratios are guaranteed! But he does not allow homers with his 66% GB%. Points league option, maybe? But he's bad.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jose-soriano
43,44,Ian Seymour,TB,"Fastball velo sucks, seems pretty dependent on the changeup. His K% will regress as a starter, I don't see much reason for hope.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/ian-seymour
44,45,Jared Jones,PIT,"Exciting arm, could have a very good career. But returning from TJ this year makes you doubt the volume and even some of the early performance. Decent IL stash to start the year.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/jared-jones
45,46,Grayson Rodriguez,LAA,"IL stash only. Could go to the bullpen, starting to seem like a longshot that he'll ever throw 100+ innings again.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/grayson-rodriguez
46,47,Shane McClanahan,TB,"Hasn't pitched in the MLB since August 2023. We'll have to wait for spring updates, but 130+ innings in the Majors seems almost impossible at this point. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/shane-mcclanahan
47,48,Ryan Weathers,MIA,"He looks like a very good pitcher, but he has not stayed healthy and we have to wonder if he can throw 100+ innings as a starter",
48,49,Robbie Ray,SF,"Successful volume season following TJ, but the K% came down and the BB% came up. Heavy fly baller, any further lost in ""nastiness"" could be very bad for him",
49,50,Michael Soroka,ARI,"The fastball is good enough to hang around a big league rotation, but I think the ERA is going to be bad, and I think he's going to lose strikeouts. ",
50,51,Kumar Rocker,TEX,"Lots of pitches, doesn't have a walk issue. He just doesn't have a good fastball and has never exceeded 90 innings as a pro yet.",
51,52,Merrill Kelly,ARI,"Wicked changeup, the fastball survives. He's held his own, but it's a super, super low ceiling.",
52,53,Rhett Lowder,CIN,,
53,54,Richard Fitts,STL,"The MiLB results give you pause, but I like the fastball and the arsenal depth. The park shift should change, and he shouldn't have trouble staying in the STL rotation",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180539264/richard-fitts
54,55,Mick Abel,MIN,"Has some potential with the good fastball, but he needs to figure out how to not get hit so hard. History of bad walk rates and middling K%, I don't think there's much hope for him, but the change in scenery maybe makes a difference?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/mick-abel

59,60,Michael Wacha,KC,"Low K%, no upside, probably bad ratios, old. But a nasty changeup.",
60,61,Luis Morales,ATH,"Good velo, but bad results. Not a deep pitch mix. Feels more like a reliever to me. But the heavy fastball and lack of option options in the org gives me a sliver of hope.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/luis-morales
61,62,Jeffrey Springs,ATH,"Horrible fastball, 33 years old, and the park doesn't fit his style. The changeup keeps him in some games, but it's a very thin fantasy profile.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/jeffrey-springs
62,63,Dustin May,STL,"He was awful last year. The sinker losing velo is a killer, and he's never had great secondaries. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180539264/dustin-may
63,64,Jack Perkins,ATH,This could be a moot point if he ends up as a middle reliever. But he can get a bunch of whiffs. Maybe even turns into the closer?,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/jack-perkins

65,66,Corbin Burnes,ARI,"It will be August by the time he's built up, it's fine as a free IL stash, but that's it",
66,67,Seth Lugo,KC,"10 bad pitches! That's impressive. No upside, but probably 120+ not completely terrible innings?",
67,68,Trevor McDonald,SF,"Should be able to get some volume, but there are no indicators from the minors that he'll be any good",
68,69,Brandon Pfaadt,ARI,"Sadly, just doesn't seem to have the goods. K% dropped under 20%, SwStr% under 11%, has never been able to get lefties out.",
