0,1,Tarik Skubal,DET,"What needs to be said? 190+ inning super stud for the last two seasons, only Skenes and Crochet compare.",
1,2,Paul Skenes,PIT,"A clear top 3 SP. The only problem is the lack of wins, which makes a big difference in standard roto value. But he's the best ERA pitcher in the game, we can't complain too much.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/paul-skenes
2,3,Garrett Crochet,BOS,,
3,4,Hunter Greene,CIN,"Some of the best stuff in the league and he fixed his walk issue last year. Some ERA bloating may occur with the higher HR/9, but the WHIP and strikeouts will be elite",
4,5,Cole Ragans,KC,"No questions about his dominance, just needs to stay healthy",
5,6,Chris Sale,ATL,"He hasn't given us any reason to doubt the skills, but he'll be 37 and did not stay healthy last year. It's a risky pick, but you can't let him slide very far down the list. He's a top ten arm in the league when healthy.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/chris-sale
6,7,Jacob deGrom,TEX,"Did not pitch quite like a Cy Young, and you still have to worry about the injuries, but he's in a good spot to log another 27+ starts",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/181457581/jacob-degrom
7,8,Spencer Schwellenbach,ATL,"Broken elbow last year, but at least it wasn't a ligament thing, and he probably would have returned if the Braves were in contention. Great numbers across the board, high-floor, high-ceiling pitcher.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/spencer-schwellenbach
8,9,Joe Ryan,MIN,"Did everything we thought he would last year. The HR issue keeps the ERA above three, which limits the ceiling a little bit, but the WHIP and strikeouts and stability are great. Strong SP2 option for 2026.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/joe-ryan
9,10,Eury Perez,MIA,"Slight concern about innings (150?) and homers (1.3 HR/9), but the strikeouts and WHIP will be elite. Per-start SP1 upside for sure.",
10,11,Logan Webb,SF,"Volume monster, very solid pitcher. I suspect the K% will drop back down to 22%, and the ratios are usually nothing special. He's very league-specific. ",
11,12,Chase Burns,CIN,"Crazy upside. He looks like one of the best pitchers in the league, but can he stay on the mound? Probably capped around 140 innings.",
12,13,Hunter Brown,HOU,I think 2025 was a career year for him. I've got the K% losing a couple points and the BB% going up a point. Could be more like an SP3 at an SP1 price tag.,
13,14,Kyle Bradish,BAL,"Awesome numbers from 2024-2025 before and after the surgery. Looked great in late 2025 after returning, finished healthy. I have some questions about the fastball and his durability though. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/kyle-bradish
14,15,Bubba Chandler,PIT,"Elite fastball, elite walk rate in his short time in the Majors. Great durability (so far), good GB%. The sky is the limit, and we have to consider the SP1 upside he has when ranking him. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/bubba-chandler
15,16,Pablo Lopez,MIN,"K-BB% dropped to 17%, he's lost K% for two straight years now. HR issues, not great vs. LHB, getting older. Was very lucky to post a strong ERA last year. Lots of arrows pointing down here, but I think he's a fine SP3-SP4 option.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/pablo-lopez
16,17,Spencer Strider,ATL,"If he doesn't get the velo and command back, I don't know if he can be very good. 2025 was pretty discouraging. The bet would be on him needing this offseason of recovery and returning in 2026 much closer to his 2023-2024 form. But I don't know if we ever get that Strider again.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179720085/spencer-strider
17,18,Trevor Rogers,BAL,"He was very ""lucky"" in 2025, but a lot of that shouldn't be shocking. Career 9% HR/FB, great fastball and changeup, great command. Overperformance in 2025 aside, he's a solid arm in a good park.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178612600/trevor-rogers
18,19,Drew Rasmussen,TB,"Relies on soft contact and doesn't have a great breaking ball, but pinpoint command with high efficiency. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/drew-rasmussen
19,20,Nick Lodolo,CIN,"The injury concerns are less this year. Solid fastball, strong curveball and changeup. High floor when pitching, but it feels like a bit of buy high with the 2026 ADP",
20,21,Nolan McLean,NYM,"Maybe I'm too low, but I'm a bit worried about his K% ability when seeing the pitch mix, and his command has never been anything great",
21,22,Ryan Pepiot,TB,"Going back to the Trop will work wonders for Pepiot. Ceiling is limited by a lack of a great secondary pitch, but I think the floor is fantastic. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/carson-williams
22,23,MacKenzie Gore,WSH,"Maybe he'll never put it all together. Consistency has been a huge issue. But he showed the ceiling in April-May of last year and holds onto a high career K%. I think there's some hope, and I imagine he'll be pretty cheap in 2026.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/mackenzie-gore
23,24,Kris Bubic,KC,"It's really just a question of health. Lots of injuries the last few years and finished the year hurt. Non-dominant stuff, but he's a good pitcher",
24,25,Sonny Gray,BOS,,
25,26,Sandy Alcantara,MIA,"Bad luck and rust crushed his first half, but he was his normal self again over the last 15 starts. Solid value this year, but no true upside any longer at age 30 with a proven mediocre K%.",
26,27,Kodai Senga,NYM,"Has not found consistency or health in the Majors, and now he's pretty old. But there's strikeout and ERA upside with the forkball he has.",
27,28,Shane Smith,CWS,"Very strong fastball + changeup foundation. Was impressive in his first year as a full-time starter after being a Rule V pick. Needs to lower the BB% a touch, but it's a solid profile. High upside arm.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/shane-smith
28,29,Nathan Eovaldi,TEX,"Good pitcher, no doubt, but a ticking time bomb with the age and all of these injuries from 2025",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/181457581/nathan-eovaldi
29,30,Gavin Williams,CLE,"Added a sinker, which could lower the ERA, but his K% (24%) and BB% (11%) have always been trouble in his MLB career. Big guy, good stuff... but overall he's not going to be anything special",
30,31,Shane Baz,BAL,"Was crushed by a 2.0 HR/9 at home last year. Park shift will help. Good fastball, deep arsenal. I think he's a solid floor arm with a little bit of upside if the K% can tick up a bit more with the velo.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/shane-baz
31,32,Jack Flaherty,DET,"Better K-BB% stuff than you'd think, but a constant HR issue and inconsistencies. But he's a reliable 150+ strikeout bet.",
32,33,Andrew Abbott,CIN,He's going to go for a higher HR/FB some year and it will be a disaster. But you can't fully deny the success he's had. ,
33,34,Connelly Early,BOS,,
34,35,Zebby Matthews,MIN,"The K% and BB% are there, he just keeps giving up a ton of tanks. I'd rather buy than sell on the guy, but he doesn't seem like a guy who will put up a great-looking ERA until he tames down the FB% a bit.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/zebby-matthews
35,36,Tanner Bibee,CLE,"The fastballs were a disaster in 2025 and that hung him out to dry. It's not a pretty picture, but the success he had in 2023-2024 make me want to think he can bounce back a bit.",
36,37,Mike Burrows,HOU,"Had some success in the Majors, stayed healthy and threw 130 innings. Elite changeup with some potential in the fastball. Needs to improve with the heater, but if he does, he could be quite effective.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/mike-burrows
37,38,Ryne Nelson,ARI,"Great fastball, but very high usage on it. Not a great putaway pitch. Solid floor pitcher though with that great heater.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/181175066/ryne-nelson
38,39,Simeon Woods Richardson,MIN,He introduced a new splitter and dominated late in the year when he started using it more. Pretty enticing guy for 2026 at the cost. But that's putting most of your chips on the splitter truly being a difference-maker.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/simeon-woods-richardson
39,40,Braxton Ashcraft,PIT,"Need clarity on what the Pirates do with their rotation, but Ashcraft could be a pretty solid arm for them. Maybe not a great fantasy option with a lower K%, but he's interesting. Love the SwStr% and GB% combo.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/braxton-ashcraft
40,41,Edward Cabrera,MIA,"Cut five points off the BB%, but threw changeups and curves 50% of the time. His sinker was awful. I predict that BB% will be 10% again and he'll go back to mostly his old ways. Fade!",
41,42,Reese Olson,DET,"Fastballs are a real problem, and he's not been able to stay healthy. But he has two elite secondaries, and that gives him some upside on any given week",
42,43,Noah Cameron,KC,"Fastballs stinks, low velo. But deep pitch mix and non-awful command. Could turn into a solid innings-eater, and it's a good park for him",
43,44,Yusei Kikuchi,LAA,"Projections will like him to bounce-back a little bit, but he's a middling pitcher at best. I'd rather shoot for upside late in the draft than take a guy who we're pretty sure will be an ERA drain.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/yusei-kikuchi
44,45,Parker Messick,CLE,"Good signs early in his career, seems like a tough dude to hit, but you never know. His velo is middling and there's no great pitch. Low ceiling.",
45,46,Bailey Ober,MIN,"His HR issues and low K% really limit his fantasy ceiling even if he does bounce back to 2023-2024 form. And we saw how bad it can go with him in 2025. I don't see much reason to draft him, but it's reasonable to think you can get a 125 strikeout season with a 1.10 WHIP next year if he's healthy. ",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177266695/bailey-ober
46,47,Cade Cavalli,WSH,His SwStr% + Ball% + GB% trio were elite. Great fastball and curveball with a sinker/change behind it. Was very unlucky last year. Health pointing upward. Breakout season is coming.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176667994/cade-cavalli
47,48,Jack Leiter,TEX,"Big fastball, bad command. Plenty of upside if he can refine himself a bit, and he went above 150 innings last year. Some reasons for optimism.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/181457581/jack-leiter
48,49,Casey Mize,DET,"Fastball sucks still, but the splitter was good enough to keep him about a league average arm",
49,50,Jose Soriano,LAA,"Bad ratios are guaranteed! But he does not allow homers with his 66% GB%. Points league option, maybe? But he's bad.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/178121572/jose-soriano

51,52,Mitch Keller,PIT,"Known commodity at this point. Good for QS, but not great at anything and mostly a negativ over a full season. Reserve for super deep leagues and streaming.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/mitch-keller
52,53,Robby Snelling,MIA,"Questions about when he'll be up and how he'll transition, but he's ready for the MLB and the numbers last year were elite!",
53,54,Sean Burke,CWS,"Finished strong with the K%, but was hurt a lot, and he's never thrown enough strikes. There's non-zero upside with him at his age with the fastball he has, but overall it's a thumbs-down.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/176288033/sean-burke
54,55,Jacob Lopez,ATH,"Had a good K% and BB% last year, but it seemed a little bit lucky with a low SwStr%. He's also a heavy FB% guy, which is very bad vs. RHB in that home park.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/jacob-lopez
55,56,Hunter Barco,PIT,"Not a lock for the rotation by any means, but is the only considerable lefty they have. Pretty nasty left-handed sinker with a split and slider. High upside arm, I'd say.

56,57,Ian Seymour,TB,"Fastball velo sucks, seems pretty dependent on the changeup. His K% will regress as a starter, I don't see much reason for hope.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/180243530/ian-seymour
57,58,Jared Jones,PIT,"Exciting arm, could have a very good career. But returning from TJ this year makes you doubt the volume and even some of the early performance. Decent IL stash to start the year.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/177585967/jared-jones

65,66,Mick Abel,MIN,"Has some potential with the good fastball, but he needs to figure out how to not get hit so hard.
