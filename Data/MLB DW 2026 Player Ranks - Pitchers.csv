105,106,Jack Perkins,ATH,$1.68,This could be a moot point if he ends up as a middle reliever. But he can get a bunch of whiffs. Maybe even turns into the closer?,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/179273161/jack-perkins
106,107,Johan Oviedo,BOS,$4.60,"I don't think he has enough command to stick as a starter, but the Red Sox are going to give it a try.",
107,108,AJ Blubaugh,HOU,$2.23,Seems like an SP4 type at best. Good fastball but nothing behind it. Questionable if he's even in the Astros rotation.,https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/182515558/aj-blubaugh
108,109,Brady Singer,CIN,$6.55,"Ran hot in HR/FB and turned in a non-awful season, but there's no ceiling whatsoever and a very low floor if he starts giving up homers",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/182026238/brady-singer

112,113,Kutter Crawford,BOS,$5.84,"Who will win these 4-5 spots in the Boston rotation? That's the most important question. Crawford is okay, but a big home run issue. I don't think he'll keep a job for long",

117,118,Rhett Lowder,CIN,$5.06,"When does he get into the MLB rotation? Can he continue to limit homers like he has in the past? There's no ceiling, so that takes him out of standard league talk.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/182026238/rhett-lowder

119,120,Cristian Javier,HOU,$8.01,"I guess the Astros will have to use him, but he's like a 22% K% guy max with no command, and the stuff models don't like his pitches either",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/182515558/cristian-javier
