111,112,Rhett Lowder,CIN,$4.76,"When does he get into the MLB rotation? Can he continue to limit homers like he has in the past? There's no ceiling, so that takes him out of standard league talk.",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/182026238/rhett-lowder
112,113,Kyle Harrison,BOS,$5.34,"Good fastball, interesting pitcher. But will he find and keep a rotation spot in Boston? I don't know!",
113,114,Cristian Javier,HOU,$7.60,"I guess the Astros will have to use him, but he's like a 22% K% guy max with no command, and the stuff models don't like his pitches either",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/182515558/cristian-javier
