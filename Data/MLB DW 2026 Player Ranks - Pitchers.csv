1,Joe Ryan,MIN,"Did everything we thought he would last year. The HR issue keeps the ERA above three, which limits the ceiling a little bit, but the WHIP and strikeouts and stability are great. Strong SP2 option for 2026.",
2,Pablo Lopez,MIN,"K-BB% dropped to 17%, he's lost K% for two straight years now. HR issues, not great vs. LHB, getting older. Was very lucky to post a strong ERA last year. Lots of arrows pointing down here, but I think he's a fine SP3-SP4 option.",
3,MacKenzie Gore,WSH,"Maybe he'll never put it all together. Consistency has been a huge issue. But he showed the ceiling in April-May of last year and holds onto a high career K%. I think there's some hope, and I imagine he'll be pretty cheap in 2026.",
4,Shane Smith,CWS,"Very strong fastball + changeup foundation. Was impressive in his first year as a full-time starter after being a Rule V pick. Needs to lower the BB% a touch, but it's a solid profile. High upside arm.",
5,Zebby Matthews,MIN,,
6,Cade Cavalli,WSH,His SwStr% + Ball% + GB% trio were elite. Great fastball and curveball with a sinker/change behind it. Was very unlucky last year. Health pointing upward. Breakout season is coming.,
7,Simeon Woods Richardson,MIN,,
8,Bailey Ober,MIN,"His HR issues and low K% really limit his fantasy ceiling even if he does bounce back to 2023-2024 form. And we saw how bad it can go with him in 2025. I don't see much reason to draft him, but it's reasonable to think you can get a 125 strikeout season with a 1.10 WHIP next year if he's healthy. ",
9,Sean Burke,CWS,"Finished strong with the K%, but was hurt a lot, and he's never thrown enough strikes. There's non-zero upside with him at his age with the fastball he has, but overall it's a thumbs-down.",
10,Chase Dollander,COL,"Super deep points leagues, there still has to be some hope that he can become a 150-strikeout guy? Maybe?",https://www.mlbdatawarehouse.com/i/175451426/chase-dollander
11,Josiah Gray,WSH,He'll need to be way better than he ever has after recovering from TJ at age 28. I don't think that'll happen!,
12,Brad Lord,WSH,"Will probably be in the rotation, but he's not good. Single-digit SwStr% with a home run problem. ",
